<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
Marie sat staring at the thin, hard-featured man
opposite her.  His eyes, through the great bone
spectacles, were magnified till they looked like some
gigantic insect's, and his nervous hands shuffled
among the papers on the table before him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Miss Helmar," he said, "very sorry,
but that is all there is.  Your father was a man who
indulged his hobbies, and you must admit that a
hobby which carries one into every country on the
globe is rather expensive."
</p>

<p>
Across the girl's mind came the image of her father,
whom she had followed weeping to the cemetery only
yesterday.  His tall, thin figure, with its haggard,
pain-racked face, was clearly before her mental vision.
</p>

<p>
When her mother, who was now only a shadowy
remembrance, had faded out of her life, Marie had
been taken to the convent and left with the nuns.
Her childhood had been passed in even, colorless days,
in which the monotony had only been broken when
she had been called into the library once a week to
hear the letter from her father, who was wandering
in far countries, which, for her, meant only the
colored maps in her geography books.
</p>

<p>
It seemed little longer than yesterday, when the
Mother Superior had sent for her that last time.  She
could almost hear the gentle voice now.
</p>

<p>
"Your father is coming home to Vienna, Marie.
He writes he has had his solicitor take a house for
him on the <i>Blumen Strasse</i>.  You are to leave us, dear
child, and make a home for him."
</p>

<p>
This wonderful father of whom she had been
dreaming, was going to take her with him to a home
of their own!  She had wanted so to belong to some
one.  The holiday time had always meant heartaches
for her.  She could remember how wistfully she
had stood with her small face pressed against the
convent windows, watching her schoolmates as they left
to spend those days at home.  She remembered how
bare and empty the convent had looked after they
were gone, and she had been left to wander about
alone, till the school days should begin again.  The
small, hard pillow on her narrow bed, would be soaked
with tears as she read and re-read the small packet
of letters from her father, that told her so little.
These quiet years, while they had succeeded in
suppressing her natural affection, had only stored it
away as it were, and the girl was pathetically eager
to pour it out to the father whom she scarcely knew.
</p>

<p>
The wonder and interest of those first few months,
woke in her mind ideals and dreams she had never had
in the seclusion of the convent, where her day had
been bounded by prayers in the morning and the
vesper bell at night.
</p>

<p>
Professor Helmar's life had been wrapped up in
his pretty wife.  She had been much younger than
the reticent, rather shy man, whose interests were
all centered in the dry dust of forgotten ages,
until the living sunshine of her own hair had flashed
across his gray vista.  There had been six joyous,
wonderful years, and then suddenly she had gone,
leaving the place she had filled, empty indeed.  Her
short illness and death had been a blow so severe to
him, that he hesitated only long enough to put their
little daughter, whose golden hair reminded him too
forcibly of his loss, in the care of the nuns, then threw
himself once more into his researches among the ruins
of antiquity.
</p>

<p>
That was twelve years ago, and weary at last,
longing for the companionship of the daughter who
was the symbol of the love that had meant so much
to him, he had come back.  And in this short year,
Marie, wide-eyed and passionately eager to be all
that this wonderful father wanted her to be, had
blossomed from the shy convent child into the promise
of charming young womanhood.
</p>

<p>
The little house in the <i>Blumen Strasse</i> was filled
with his books, and the pictures her mother had loved.
The girl, inspired by her father, came to know and
understand art, for Professor Helmar's quest after
the evolution of beauty, had carried him through the
ages, from its shadowy beginning among the great
temples of Egypt, to its culmination in the Greece
of Pericles.  Then, like a bolt out of the blue, had
come his last illness and death, and now she was
alone.
</p>

<p>
Something of all this flashed across her mind in the
few seconds the solicitor waited for his answer, much
as a man's life passes before him when he is drowning.
She looked about her helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"But," she scarcely recognized her own voice,
"what am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
"That, my dear young lady," this time the solicitor
looked over the great spectacles, "is something
you will have to decide for yourself.  Your father
gave you a very good education, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"I was at the Sacred Heart Convent from the
time I was six until just about a year ago.  They
taught me French and music, and a little drawing.  I
never thought I should have to use them."  Indeed,
the idea that the necessities of life were not one's by
right, had never entered her mind.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor was beginning to gather up the
papers.
</p>

<p>
"We never know, my dear young lady, when we
will be overtaken by adversity.  It is always well to
have something to fall back upon.  Couldn't you
teach&mdash;er&mdash;say French?  Music?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's tear-filled eyes wandered about the
tasteful room.  With what happiness she had come
here, and after so brief a space of time, this
overwhelmingly crushing blow.  All her brief life,
sheltered as it had been in the convent, her mind had never
dwelt upon the nature of material things.  There
had always been new, clean frocks for her.  There
had always been sufficient food to eat without the
thought of how it had been provided, always the
haven of her scrupulously clean, little white room.
These things all were, there was no thought in her
mind of how they came to be, nor the possibility that
they would ever cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
But now, the meaning of the shriveled old solicitor's
words were making themselves plain to her.  The
means of a livelihood had been taken away.  She
must, in order to live, provide for herself, either
through some physical exertion, or some mental
effort.  What was she to do?
</p>

<p>
She had never learned to walk alone.  The quiet
cloisters, the sweet-faced nuns, had been a prop on
which she had leaned.  When her father had returned
from those journeys into foreign lands, where his
discoveries and scientific studies had furnished dreams
for her lonely childhood, she had leaned as heavily on
him, and now that this support had been taken away,
she stood like one swaying dizzily on the edge of a
precipice.
</p>

<p>
It was so short a time ago, only a year, that he
had returned, but how different from the strong,
stalwart, handsome man she had been expecting.
</p>

<p>
Again his face seemed to float before her, pale,
thin, drawn with suffering, with its sad eyes always
seeming to ask for something.  Her poor father!
The love and companionship she had dreamed of had
been too long deferred, and he had gone away on that
last great journey, only to leave her worse than alone
in the end.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will not want to keep up this
place," the solicitor's voice broke in on her thoughts,
"it will be quite beyond your affording."
</p>

<p>
She looked about her at the things she had learned
to love.  After the bare convent walls, the simple
beauty of this little home, had seemed luxury itself.
The really fine etchings which had been her mother's,
the delicate little Tanagra figurines her father had
brought her, the bits of Pompeiian glass flashing back
the prismatic colors of the tears that must once have
filled them, the little bronze Narcissus, which she had
loved above everything, must she give them all up?
</p>

<p>
Through the long windows she caught a glimpse of
the tiny garden where her father and she had always
had their coffee.  The old locust tree was even now
dropping its fragrant white petals on the flagging.
He had loved the scent of these white blossoms!  How
could she leave it all?
</p>

<p>
"Where shall I go?  Where can I go?"  She was
frightened; the world seemed such a vast, unexplored
place to her who had known only the convent and
these sheltered walls.
</p>

<p>
The papers were all gathered together now, and
the hands of the solicitor were busy putting them
carefully into his black leather portfolio.
</p>

<p>
"You have about two thousand crowns, Miss Helmar,"
he told her, "to be exact, I should say, that
after all expenses are paid, there will be about one
hundred crowns a month for you, for a year.  That
is not a munificent sum, but it will maintain you
until you begin to earn your living."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked helplessly about her.  Her knowledge
of money was not very extensive, but she knew that
one hundred crowns a month would not even begin to
pay the rent of this little nest her father had brought
her to.  And there was the housekeeper to be paid,
food to be bought, clothes.  She sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall I go to live?" she faltered.
</p>

<p>
"You will find many places, many places," reassured
the solicitor, "I dare say I may be able to find
you&mdash;er&mdash;one or two pupils&mdash;er&mdash;if you are not
exorbitant in your prices."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I'll not be," she answered him eagerly.
"I'll ask the least possible, Herr Gutman.  I&mdash;I
suppose I had better seek a room for myself this&mdash;this
afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"The sooner, the better," the tone was unsympathetic,
there were too many cases such as this, stored
away among his files.  "The less time you stay here,
the more <i>kronen</i> you will have for the year."  He
picked up his shining black hat, "I must bid you good
morning, Miss Helmar.  If there is anything I can
do, let me know.  Of course, I shall want to know
your new address," and with a slight bow he left her.
</p>

<p>
Unpleasant as his crabbed features were, they were
better than no one, and after the door had closed on
his thin figure, she felt terrifyingly alone.
</p>

<p>
All her life she had been led to believe that Hunger
and Want, those two cruel sisters, would never knock
at her door, but here they were, actually grinning at
her elbow.  When this small sum that stood between
her and starvation was gone, what was she to do?
Suppose she couldn't get any pupils?  Suppose she
could find no way of earning her living.  The thought
sent her blond head down on her arms, and shook
her slender, black-clad figure with sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, Fräulein!" it was old Minna, the housekeeper,
who found her, and whose broad hand tried
to pat some comfort into the shaking shoulders.
"Ach, Fräulein, you must not cry so, it is much
better for the good Herr to be at rest.  He was in
pain so long, it is much better so."
</p>

<p>
"I am alone, Minna, I am alone," sobbed the girl,
"nobody wants me, nobody needs me, I'm alone."
</p>

<p>
Minna dabbed her eye with the corner of her stiff
white apron.
</p>

<p>
"You must not cry, Fräulein," she begged, "you
must not cry!  Come, lie down awhile, and when you
are rested, you will feel better!"
</p>

<p>
"I must leave here, Minna," sobbed the girl, "I
have no money now&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm poor&mdash;I must go
away&mdash;to-day.  I don't know where!  I don't know
where!"
</p>

<p>
Minna's broad bosom heaved sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"Why not go back to the good sisters at the
Sacred Heart?" she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That was my thought," replied Marie between
her sobs, and indeed, all that first bitter night after
her father's death, she had longed for the comforting
arms of the Mother Superior, and the little
French sister who had been her dearest friend.
</p>

<p>
"Why not go there, then?"  The problem seemed
so simple to the good German woman.
</p>

<p>
"I promised father," explained Marie, "that I
wouldn't.  You see, he was always afraid I would
become a nun.  He said I was never meant to be shut
away from the world; but, oh, Minna, I'm so afraid."
</p>

<p>
"Tut-tut, Fräulein, what need you fear?"  For
Minna there was no danger that she could not meet
with the aid of her ready tongue and able arms.
"Can't you keep this pretty house?"
</p>

<p>
"I am poor now, Minna," Marie told her sadly.
"I must find a place not so expensive, I must find
pupils," and at the thought the golden head went
down again on her folded arms.
</p>

<p>
The old woman stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"What about me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted her head, startled.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said, "I hadn't thought!"
</p>

<p>
Minna pursed her lips, her brow wrinkling into a
heavy frown for a moment, then suddenly, her face
cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind about me, Fräulein," she said.  "I
have been wanting a rest.  I shall take it for a week.
After that there are plenty of places for good housekeepers."
</p>

<p>
"But where can I go?"  The blue eyes were very
wistful, the world seemed so terrifyingly large and
strange.
</p>

<p>
Minna thought a moment.
</p>

<p>
"If the Fräulein would not find it too plain," she
ventured, "I can take her to a nice place."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is too plain, Minna; don't you understand
that I am poor?  Will you take me there, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I will."  Minna was all eagerness.  "It
is quite on the other side of the city, Fräulein, but
it is clean, and I think we can get it cheap.  My
friend is a musician," this with some pride, "he and
his wife live there.  I'll get my bonnet.  We'll go
right away!" and she bustled out to prepare for the
journey.
</p>

<p>
Marie sat a moment looking about her.  The things
she loved and which her father had taught her to
understand, everything that had grown dear to her,
she must leave them all, for the grim-faced Herr
Gutman had made it very plain to her that it was
only by selling all these that she was to have the
means to live at all.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, she rose to her feet, and went into her little
room with its pretty pink and white hangings, its
dainty bed.  For a long time she stood and stared at
herself in the mirror.  The sad face stared back at
her, made whiter by the black of her mourning frock.
There were deep shadows under her blue eyes, one
or two strands of fair hair had escaped from their
fastenings.  Wearily she brushed them back and dried
her tears.  She pulled a small black leather trunk
out of the cupboard and began packing it.  The tears
started afresh as she laid her belongings neatly in
the trays and put in the dainty piles of lingerie.
Marie loved beautiful things; she loved to feel the
touch of fine linen next to her white skin.  She loved
the dainty ribbons, tied across her young breast.
But ribbons, bows and silk stockings would be
impossible in the future.
</p>

<p>
The last frock packed, the last pair of shoes put
in, she closed and locked the little trunk, then, with
trembling lips, she pinned on her black hat and
slipped into her coat.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready, Minna," she called, as she came back
into the living-room, "we must waste no time."
</p>

<p>
The good woman bustled in, resplendent in her
Sunday bonnet.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ready too, Fräulein," she said as she
buttoned across her ample bosom the jacket that had
evidently been made for her in less buxom days.  "I'm
ready too, shall we start?"
</p>

<p>
With a last look back, Marie went down the
stairs and out into that world of which she knew so
little.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
During the long ride across the city, old Minna
kept up a steady chatter.  Her one idea was to
comfort the girl.  There was no thought of her own
necessity for seeking a new position.  There were
plenty of places for cooks and housekeepers, but this
frail little creature, who sat beside her with the black
veil drawn down over her face to hide the tears, what
could she do?
</p>

<p>
Presently they got off the tram, and Minna leading
the way, hurried up a narrow street, filled with
children and gossiping women.  They turned in at a
doorway next to a delicatessen shop.  On the steps, a
little girl of about eight, with very tightly braided
hair, was hushing a fat baby to sleep.  The child
moved aside for them to pass, and they made their
way up the long, dark stair.  The air was heavy with
the smell of cooking, mixed with that of hot soapsuds.
</p>

<p>
Two flights up, Minna knocked loudly at a door,
in front of which a tiny point of gas was sputtering
in a crooked jet.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened by a thin, little woman, in a
clean calico dress, with a small black apron tied over
it.  She wore great round spectacles, through which
her sharp black eyes twinkled.  She tipped her chin
in a curious way, as she looked at them.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, Minna," she cried, cordially, "come in, come
in.  It is so long since Shatzi and I have seen you."
</p>

<p>
She held the door wide, and Minna stood aside for
Marie to enter.
</p>

<p>
"I have brought a young lady," she said, "who
wants a room to live in.  I told her I thought you
might have a place for her."
</p>

<p>
Their hostess pushed forward a chair for Marie
and motioned Minna to a seat on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, sit down," she said hospitably, "I'll
get a cup of coffee and some <i>kuchen</i>, and then we can
talk," and she bustled out to prepare refreshments
for her guests.
</p>

<p>
Marie glanced about the neat little room.  Against
the walls were arranged stiffly, old-fashioned black
horsehair chairs, each with a white knitted antimacassar
pinned neatly on the back.  In the window a
canary fluted, his tiny throat swelling with ecstatic
trills as he swung in his cage over the shining leaves
of a little rubber tree.  Primly in its corner stood the
sofa, place of honor, where Minna now sat, her holiday
finery spread out about her.
</p>

<p>
On the tiny mantel stood a crowd of china ornaments,
jolly looking little dogs with huge bows about
their necks, gilt and blue shepherdesses, very small
vases, decorated with very large roses.  In the center,
a faded photograph of an empty-faced little girl with
two blond braids over her shoulders, stared stiffly
out of a frame made of sea shells and dried flowers
twined about the ornately lettered phrase, "<i>In
liebender Erinnerung</i>."  Marie, reading the tender
phrase, smiled wistfully.  No one was so plain or so
unimportant but that in some heart they were
enshrined "in loving memory."
</p>

<p>
She was impressed by the spotlessness of everything.
She found herself wondering, if each little
object had its place marked on the shelf so that it
could be put back when it had been dusted.
</p>

<p>
Over the mantel hung a brilliantly colored chromo
of a sad-eyed Christ, His blue robe opened at the
breast, showing a gilt and bleeding heart.  There
were two or three other religious pictures, but every
other available space on the dingy little walls was
hung with photographs of the same empty-faced little
girl, in various stages of growth.
</p>

<p>
Old Minna, her hands, in their brown thread mittens,
folded in her lap, sat blinking her lashless eyelids.
There was always a certain dignified manner
which accompanied the wearing of her best clothes,
and she was wrapped in it to-day, so that Marie
scarcely knew her for the same, plain-spoken, good
humored old woman who had taken care of the little
house in the <i>Blumen Strasse</i>.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice the girl opened her lips by way of
starting a conversation, but closed them again and
relapsed into an uneasy silence, suppressed by the
majestic dignity of the old housekeeper.
</p>

<p>
Presently, the hostess returned with a tray, which
she set on the center table, first having carefully
removed the lamp and a large embossed album, and
folded up into a neat square the red-fringed cloth.
There was coffee in a highly decorated pot, cups
equally ornate, one with a gilt initial on its side, a
plate of plain cake, with a richly sugared top, and a
small pitcher of milk.
</p>

<p>
"Now," she said, "while we have our coffee, we can
talk.  Is it a room to live in, you want?"
</p>

<p>
Marie opened her lips to answer, but Minna
broke in.
</p>

<p>
"The Fräulein is the daughter of my poor master,
who has just died," she said.  The little old woman
shook her head in pity, glancing at Marie over the
edge of her spectacles like a bright-eyed bird.  "She
is quite poor now," continued the housekeeper, "ach,
yes, even rich folks can spend all their money, and
now she's all alone.  I think it would be nice for you
to have her here."
</p>

<p>
Their hostess tilted her chin grotesquely as she
eyed the girl through her thick glasses.
</p>

<p>
"We have an extra room, yes, it would be company
for me while Shatzi is away," and then quite
suddenly she turned to Minna.  "She looks like Frieda,"
she said softly, her eyes straying mistily to the many
pictures of the empty-faced little girl, "she can stay
with us."
</p>

<p>
Marie smiled at her gratefully, glancing somewhat
dubiously at Frieda's photograph.  This would be
much better than going out among people of whom
she knew nothing.  Herr Gutman was to attend to
the selling of her few belongings.  Minna could
close the house and send her trunk.  She would go
now to the solicitor's office and make arrangements.
</p>

<p>
Frau Schultz showed them the little room she was
to occupy.  There was a narrow yellowish wooden
bed in it, with a starched counterpane and a stiffly
frilled pillow sham across which was embroidered in
red, "<i>Guten Morgen</i>."  Over the yellow wooden
dresser hung a cheap mirror.  The glass was wavy
and blotched in places where the mercury had worn
away.  Marie wondered, as she saw the distorted
reflection of herself, if the compliment Frau Schultz
had paid her had been deserved.  A small chair completed
the furnishings, excepting a small plaster figure
of the Virgin against the wall, with a holy water
stoup under it.  It was a tiny cupboard of a place,
but neat and spotless.  Marie stood and looked down
from the small window into the courtyard onto which
it gave.  Between the houses hung rows of freshly
washed linen, all manner of garments swinging in
shameless abandon, but the courtyard, though barren
and unattractive, was scrupulously clean.  She
thought of the cool sweetness of the garden she was
leaving, of the old locust tree and its falling blossoms,
the comfortable wicker chair in which her father used
to sit through the sunny mornings.  She turned away
with a sigh, her heart heavy, a lump rising in her
throat.  Frau Schultz, standing at her elbow, peered
at her with her bird-like eyes, and the girl felt
instinctively that she had found some one who would
be kind.
</p>

<p>
She broached the price shyly, timidly it was
acquiesced in by Frau Schultz, and decisively settled
by the capable Minna.
</p>

<p>
Then they went back into the little parlor again,
and to the accompaniment of Hanzi, the canary's,
operatic warblings, Minna had two more cups of
coffee and another piece of <i>kuchen</i>.  Then, brushing
the crumbs from her ample lap, she rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send your trunk right away, Fräulein," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"When can I come to stay?" Marie asked timidly.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as you wish, Fräulein," said Frau
Schultz hospitably.  "You can stay now if you
want to.  We are very simple people.  You are like
our Frieda.  We'll watch over you."
</p>

<p>
Marie explained that she must go to the solicitor's
office and arrange her affairs, and that she would be
back as soon as she could, to stay, so with many
exchanges of hearty good will between Minna and Frau
Schultz, and the promise of care for Marie, they
started down the dark stair again, Minna to go back
to the house to close it, Marie to arrange about the
source of her hundred <i>kronen</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
The first few weeks in her new home were not so
unpleasant as Marie had anticipated.  Frau Schultz
and her good husband took the girl under their wing,
and in their simple kindly way, tried to help her fit
herself to her new environment.
</p>

<p>
After all, it is only the transition period that is
difficult for any of us to live through.  We adjust
ourselves rapidly to the life that lies on either side
of it, but in that short span between what was and
what is to be, lies our keenest sorrow and suffering.
</p>

<p>
After the first hard wrench that carried her out
of the little house in the <i>Blumen Strasse</i> into these
very different surroundings, Marie began to enjoy
the companionship of the old couple.
</p>

<p>
Herr Schultz, Shatzi, as his wife called him, played
the piano in a café in an out-of-the-way corner of
the city.  He was a heavy, rather stupid old man,
who had lived his life pounding out indifferent music
on café pianos.  His round, prominent eyes looked
out into the world with a mild wonder.  His thick
gray hair was rough and unkempt, and his shabby
clothes kept his neat wife busy brushing away the
spots which, in spite of her vigilance, would persist
in garnishing them.  His heavy mouth always wore
a half-childish smile, and his manner was one of
apology for his very existence, but his little wife, with
her wrinkled face, her sharp old eyes, lived only for
him.  At first Marie wondered, but she came to
understand that no man can be so utterly devoid of
attraction, but that some woman will love him.
</p>

<p>
These simple people took the girl to their hearts.
They were staunch socialists who believed firmly in
the tenets of their order, still they realized that the
accident of birth which had placed them in the social
status in which they lived, made them not inferior,
but different from those who occupied a higher
stratum of society.  They had not failed to observe
the difference between Marie and themselves, yet it
was not in the least an obstacle to the mutual respect
and love which increased as the days passed.
</p>

<p>
Their own daughter, whose photograph was omni-present,
they had lost years before.  Frau Schultz,
whose fond, though mistaken imagination had seen
a resemblance in Marie's blond prettiness to the
plain Frieda, pointed it out to her husband, who,
always ready to acquiesce with her opinions, eagerly
agreed.
</p>

<p>
The tiny flat, with its old-fashioned furniture, with
Hanzi, the canary, singing in his cage, and the shining
leaves of the little rubber tree in the corner, came
to mean home to Marie.
</p>

<p>
The furnishings of her father's house realized less
than Herr Gutmann had anticipated.  While the
money lasted, Marie busied herself helping Frau
Schultz about her duties and sewing buttons on the
shirts which the thrifty little woman made to eke
out the scanty exchequer.
</p>

<p>
In her inexperience, she had believed that the world
was made up of people like her father and the nuns
at the convent.  People who were kind and
thoughtful, considerate of the feelings of others, each man
ready and willing to help his weaker brother.  The
splendor and riches that sparkled along the boulevards,
the fertile fields, with their bounteous harvests
that spread about the convent, this was the world to
her.  She had no realization that there might be
people who could have no share in all this.  She had
supposed that she would always be surrounded by the
comforts of a home such as the little house in the
<i>Blumen Strasse</i>.  The sudden awakening out of this
pleasing supposition, had left her dazed, breathless,
as one would feel when a supposedly secure shelter
had been suddenly shattered by wanton hands.
</p>

<p>
Although Marie's education at the convent had
given her no definite training for earning her living,
still she was not without an inherent quality of
courage, that dogged something that had made her
father go on with his life when his heart was in the
grave.  With her natural timidity, she shrank from
contact with the world of which she knew so little,
but the realization that her money was fast dwindling
away, warned her that a means of augmenting her
slender resources, must be found.  Mentally shutting
her eyes, and gulping as a child does before
taking a dose of bitter medicine, she faced the
situation.
</p>

<p>
Herr Gutmann managed to get two pupils for her.
Twice a week, Marie went to teach them the scales.
</p>

<p>
One was the small daughter of a rich brewer.  She
was a delicate, weak-eyed child, without any initiative
or interest in anything.  She always seemed to
Marie like a pale spot in the gloom of the huge
drawing-room.  Her thin legs, dangling down from
the music bench seemed ever to be seeking a resting-place,
and her transparent fingers played the scales
in a tinkling, apologetic way, making the same mistakes
in the same places, lesson after lesson.  When
Marie's patience gave out, which was seldom, for she
loved children and even had a spark of affection for
this unresponsive little creature, the pale eyes would
blink at her uncomprehendingly, and the thin fingers
would tinkle out the same mistakes in the same way.
</p>

<p>
Her other pupil was a boy of eleven, a square,
flat-faced youngster who hated the lessons and spent his
time between them in devising methods of annoyance
for his patient teacher.  He was never happier than
when, with both feet on the pedals he would come
crashing down on the keys, till poor Marie held her
ears in terror, for the boy's mother was nervous and
abhorred noise of any kind, and each lesson ended
in the servant bringing word that the <i>Gnädige Frau</i>
could not be disturbed any longer.
</p>

<p>
But even for these two pupils, Marie was grateful.
The money she earned, she put away to be used when
her own supply should have vanished.
</p>

<p>
The sum in the savings-box was still pitifully small,
when one day the servant, coming in with the usual
message about the <i>Gnädige Frau's</i> nervousness, added
that the noise disturbed her, so that in the future,
she would be obliged to have the lessons discontinued.
With an extra crash on the long-suffering piano keys,
the square-faced youngster announced that he was
glad, that he hated music, he hated teachers, hated
everything in general and Marie in particular, and
bounced out of the room.
</p>

<p>
The girl stood for a moment staring blankly at
the servant who grinned as she held the door open
for her.  She could hear the thumping footsteps of
her pupil as he bounded up the stair, and his voice
came down to her shouting his joy at the dismissal
of the hated teacher.
</p>

<p>
Her heart sank as she went down the steps into
the street.  There was still the pale-eyed child,
however, and the money left by her father was not yet
quite exhausted, why let this curt dismissal prey on
her so?  She squared her shoulders and lifted her
chin.  Things hadn't reached their worst yet.
</p>

<p>
It was raining a sad sort of drizzle that made it
difficult to be cheerful, and it was with a vague
foreboding that she turned into the street where the other
pupil lived, and rang the bell of the big house.
</p>

<p>
The man servant who let her in, took her umbrella
and threw open the door of the gloomy room.  She
missed the apologetic tinkle of the scales which usually
came from somewhere out of the distance.  Her eyes
growing accustomed to the semi-darkness, she saw
the pale-eyed child sitting at the piano, her dangling
feet groping for a resting-place, her thin hands idle
on the keys.  When the man had closed the door, the
child slid from the piano bench.
</p>

<p>
"Fräulein," she said, "I don't have to take any
lesson to-day, the doctor says it is bad for my eyes."
</p>

<p>
Marie paused in her task of unrolling her music.
</p>

<p>
"When shall I come then?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," and there was a quick note of pleasure in
the colorless little voice which hurt the girl to hear,
"I don't have to take any more lessons at all.  Here's
a note from mamma," and she handed her a small
white envelope.
</p>

<p>
Marie took it with trembling fingers.  She opened
the note and found it to be a formal one of dismissal
on account of the child's health.  It enclosed a small
sum still due.
</p>

<p>
Marie walked home through the rain.  Surely this
great world that she had seen stretch away in such
fertile fields from the convent windows, had enough to
spare for one girl who wanted so little.  The uneven
distribution of material things had never touched her
before.  Now she was beginning to realize that there
were those who had more than they could use, and
yet held tightly to it all.  How few there were like
the father whom she had lost, whose religion it had
been to share with his fellow men.
</p>

<p>
She climbed the long flights to the little Schultz
flat, disheartened.  Her landlady's sharp eyes took in
the situation at a glance.
</p>

<p>
"Both of them stopping, Fräulein?" she asked,
"never mind, drink your coffee and to-morrow you
can find others."  Her optimism stilled Marie's fears
and as she sipped the steaming beverage and munched
the cake Frau Schultz was noted for, she planned
how she would find other pupils.
</p>

<p>
And now began long days of seeking for something
into which her poor little convent-learned
accomplishments would fit.
</p>

<p>
But nobody seemed to want to study music.  Her
French was nearly perfect, the good nuns at the
Sacred Heart had seen to that.  She tried to find
some one who wished to learn, but though it happened
that just then the study of the French language was
very popular in Vienna, everyone wanted a Mademoiselle
from Paris.
</p>

<p>
She knew a little singing, a little drawing; a little,
but not enough of anything.  Her drawing, she tried
to utilize, but no one wanted to learn the gentle art
of sketching in water colors or making dainty pen
drawings.  The time had gone by for that, there were
too many art schools where one could learn to paint
boldly from the nude, in garish colors, futurist
canvasses.
</p>

<p>
How many others were trying as she was trying.
How much more competition than things for which
to compete.  This world, that seen from the convent
windows, had seemed all peaceful fields, green and
tranquil, that had given her kindness and comfort in
her father's house, what a different aspect it wore,
now that she had stepped down from her sheltered
nook.
</p>

<p>
To Marie, facing it like a timid hare brought to
bay, it seemed like a pack of snarling hounds,
quarreling over bones thrown from some more fortunate
table, wrangling and fighting, climbing on the shoulders
of each other, ruthlessly trampling down the
weaker.  She was frightened, yet filled with a bitter
wonder that here, suffering was not only a possibility,
but a certainty.
</p>

<p>
The pillow on her little yellow bed was soaked
with many tears, frightened, disappointed tears, and
still, through it all the thoughtfulness and
generosity of these two old people with whom she made
her home, kept alive in her heart faith in human
nature.  They had so little and yet that little was
divided gladly with one less fortunate than they.
</p>

<p>
The year was nearly gone now and so was the
money.  Soon she would have to supply herself from
the small box of savings, and after that, she dared
not think.  She could not be a burden to these kindly
people, knowing, as she did, that there was scarcely
enough for themselves, and that, only, with the help
of what she was paying for her tiny room.
</p>

<p>
One evening, Herr Schultz came home with the
announcement that there was a chance for her if she
cared to take it, singing in the little café where he
played.
</p>

<p>
"The salary is very small, Fräulein," he said, "but
I shall be there to bring you home each night, and
your voice is not a bad one."
</p>

<p>
Marie loathed the very thought of doing such a
thing, but she dared not refuse with a knowledge of
her ever-dwindling funds, and the danger of at last
living on the Schultz's bounty, so it was decided
that she was to go with the old man the next day and
apply for the position.
</p>

<p>
"Have you a pretty dress, Marie?" asked Herr
Schultz.  "You will have to wear something with no
neck or sleeves."
</p>

<p>
Marie made a mental inventory of her wardrobe.
There was a simple frock that could be arranged, so
she nodded.  The old man rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, "come and sing some of the
Schubert Lieder, or perhaps a little Grieg."
</p>

<p>
Her voice was a small high soprano, with a very
sweet note in it, and her natural appreciation for all
that was beautiful and tender, gave her singing an
appealing quality that more than compensated for its
lack of volume.
</p>

<p>
The old man was delighted.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he said.  "We go to-morrow," and Frau
Schultz nodded approval, as she threaded a needle,
her small head on one side, the bird-like eyes squinting
at her work.
</p>

<p>
The café or tingle-tangle where old Schultz played,
was one of the sort the outside world referred to as
Bohemian, tucked away in an obscure corner of the
city.  The proprietor was an oily-faced man whose
good humor depended entirely upon the amount of
patronage his house received.
</p>

<p>
He nodded to old Schultz and looked Marie over
appraisingly.  He noted with approval her blue eyes
and delicate features.  The mourning frock, for she
still wore black, set off the gold of her hair.
</p>

<p>
"Sing for me," he said, and to Schultz's accompaniment
and with her heart pounding, Marie sang.
</p>

<p>
"H'm," grunted the proprietor, "the voice will do,
but Gott, those songs, do you think this is a church?
Find something lively, something gay, a bit&mdash;you
know," and the girl felt her face flush at his tone.
</p>

<p>
She was about to say she couldn't, but she thought
of the little that stood between her and starvation,
and that not only she, but the good people with whom
she lived, needed this position, so swallowing hard,
she said she would try.
</p>

<p>
"And your dress," the proprietor called after them
as she and the old man were leaving, "mind you put
some dash in it!"
</p>

<p>
"It will be all right," soothed Schultz, when they
were walking down the street together, "don't mind,
<i>kleinchen</i>, I'll be there to take care of you.  We'll
go now and pick out some songs, and to-night the
good <i>Frau</i> will help you fix up the dress."
</p>

<p>
They went into a music shop, in the window of
which hung a gaudy display of popular music.  With
the help of an anæmic youth who stood behind the
counter and ogled Marie, they selected four or five,
and having paid for them out of her slender purse,
they started home.  All that afternoon they went
over the songs, the old man explaining to her how
she must sing them, with more dash, more life, and
the girl going over them patiently.
</p>

<p>
"Can't I put in one of the Schubert songs?" she
begged.  "Just so I won't feel so terribly away from
myself?" and after a good deal of debate, they
settled on "Impatience," trusting that its
swift-rung cadence might make up for its very evident
incongruity to the surroundings.
</p>

<p>
All evening, Frau Schultz and Marie pulled and
snipped and sewed at the simple frock, trying to
arrange it so as to please her new employer, and
when at last the girl stood before the little mirror
and looked at her reflection, she was startled at the
change she saw.  Her slender arms were white, even
against the white of the gown, and her almost childish
throat and young bosom with its delicate curves
looked very lovely where the lace fell away.  She had
piled her hair high on her head, and the good Frau,
after searching among her belongings, had unearthed
an old-fashioned high comb which she had insisted
upon her wearing.
</p>

<p>
"You look very sweet," she said, "to-morrow you'll
win every one's heart."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to do that," sighed Marie.  "It's a
horrid place, really Frau Schultz, but I must do my
best.  That means a lot to all of us, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The good little woman kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"There, there," she said, "if things don't go right,
you must not worry.  Shatzi and I are always here.
Now go to bed," and with a kind little pat, she took
the lamp and left her, closing the door after her.
</p>

<p>
For a long time Marie sat and looked at the girl
in the mirror.  What would be the outcome of this
venture, she wondered.  What would her father have
said, if he could have known.  If she could have looked
ahead, how she would have hated the little white dress
that she laid aside so carefully, how she would have
hated the old-fashioned comb, which she drew out to
permit her wonderful hair to come tumbling about
her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
What an all wise Providence it is that has made
us blind to what lies before us!  How few would have
the courage to go on if they could look even one day
ahead!
</p>

<p>
As she turned down her lamp and slipped into bed,
her only thought was, could she manage to keep this
place that had come to her when she so much
needed it.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
The "Two Eagles" was one of those little cafés
which abound in Vienna; good beer, music, and freedom;
the rendezvous of students, with a fair sprinkling
of the military.
</p>

<p>
To Marie, peeping out from the tiny, none-too-clean
room, they had given her to dress in, it seemed
far worse than it really was, for the girl's eyes had
only looked on life at the convent, and from the
windows of her father's house.  The clicking of the steins
on the bare tables, the rough voices of the waiters as
they hurried back and forth, the scraping of chairs
on the sanded floor, the floating layers of blue smoke
through which the lights blurred, the students with
their wide black ties and unkempt hair, with here and
there a splash of color where some officers sat sprawled
about a table.  This was a world of which she had
never dreamed, and she shrank instinctively from its
cheap tawdriness.  Through it all, breaking out in
shrill peals, or suppressed giggles, came the laughter
of women.  Laughter more than anything is indicative
of caste, and this coarse mirth was strange to
Marie's ears.
</p>

<p>
Away at the far end, was the platform on which
Herr Schultz was playing the piano, with a white-faced,
wizened young man beside him, scraping on a
violin.
</p>

<p>
How was she to get there?  The time had come.
One of the greasy waiters had just knocked at her
door and told her they were ready, but the route lay
in and out among those many tables, those staring
faces.  She never knew how she reached the platform.
She was keenly conscious of the scraping of her shoes
on the sanded floor, and of the voices about her.
</p>

<p>
One woman laughed in a sneering way as she passed
her table, and her companion reached out and tried
to grab Marie's hand.  In pulling away, she almost
fell over the shining boot of a young, round-faced
officer, a boot which had been thrust in her way
purposely, and whose owner roared with mirth at her
terrible confusion.  She was vaguely conscious of an
older man at his side, at whose sharp word the
offending boot was withdrawn.  As she passed, here and
there rough voices flung appraising phrases at her,
that sent the blood flaming into her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
But after what seemed an interminable journey,
she at last reached the little platform and the shelter
of Herr Schultz's side.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, child," whispered the kindly old man,
"you'll grow used to it all.  What shall we sing first?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's heart was in her throat.  She felt as
though she never should be able to even speak, to
sing was an impossibility.  The white-faced violinist
murmured an encouraging word.  Herr Schultz
patted her arm, his weak mouth tremulous with
reassuring smiles.
</p>

<p>
She told herself that she was in no way a part of
this cheap, vulgar place.  It need not touch her.  She
was there to sing, to earn her living.  Her cheeks
burned, but she swallowed bravely, and as Herr
Schultz struck the opening chords, she turned and
faced the room, which seemed to swim in the blue haze
of the tobacco smoke.  Before her eyes was a blur of
black and white, with here and there a spot of color
made by some soldier's uniform.  Her small, sweet
voice trembled, and she sang the rollicking music-hall
ditty, as though it were a sentimental ballad, but she
seemed to have struck the vacuous fancy of the young
officer, over whose foot she had tripped, and while
her voice still clung to the last note, he acclaimed his
approval.
</p>

<p>
Indeed she seemed to have pleased the majority of
her audience, who, with their characteristic love of
music, applauded vociferously, pounding on the tables
with their beer mugs and shouting noisily.
</p>

<p>
She resumed her seat with the pleasure that
appreciation, from no matter how mean a source, always
brings.
</p>

<p>
As she waited while the old man turned over the
music before beginning another song, her eyes were
caught and held by the pale blue ones of the young
officer who had started the applause.  She felt her
face grow scarlet under his gaze.  Some intangible
instinct warned her of danger, but she was grateful
to him for his demonstration of approval, so she tried
to force her trembling lips to smile her thanks.  He
was quite young, his pale blond hair worn stiff in
the familiar paint-brush style, was almost white
against his flushed forehead, and his full lips were
very red.  He was sprawled in his chair with his thick
legs in their tight blue trousers, straight out before
him, his head sunk between his shoulders.  The man
at his side touched him quietly on the arm and said
a few words which Marie could not catch.  The youth
pulled himself together and turned once more to the
table and through all of her next song, which was
the Schubert one, he paid no more heed to her.  Even
at its conclusion, he did not vouchsafe the approbation
he had given her at first.  But the rest of the
room was unanimous in their praise.
</p>

<p>
She was trembling.  She had pleased them, and she
was so anxious to please.  Herr Schultz looked at
her proudly over his shoulder, as he struck the opening
chords for the white-faced violinist, who smirked
at her.
</p>

<p>
After a brief rest, she rose at the old man's nod,
and sang again, and again, till her throat felt tight,
her voice grew husky and her eyes smarted with the
unaccustomed tobacco fumes.  But her audience was
insatiable.
</p>

<p>
A noisy student rapped loudly on his table and
called for yet another song.  His companions echoed
the command and leered laughingly into her face.
</p>

<p>
From another table in a corner, a fat, oily looking
man with diamonds on his fingers, and a heavy triple
chin, beckoned to her with what he must have thought
was an ingratiating smile.  But the woman with him,
a slim, dark little creature, with thickly rouged lips
and cloudy black hair, jerked angrily at his arm, and
he swung about in his chair so that Marie saw only
his great back.
</p>

<p>
Brower, the proprietor, came up and patted her
roughly on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"She caught on, Schultz," he wheezed in his heavy
voice, that was habitually hoarse from beer and
tobacco smoke.  "I think she'll do!"
</p>

<p>
She had succeeded, objectionable and unpleasant
as these surroundings and the people were.  She had
conquered, she had overcome the harrowing
embarrassment that had shocked her refined nature.  She
felt a certain sense of pride that she had not failed,
that she had not been vanquished by her weaker
emotions.  It gave her more confidence in herself.  If
she could do this, she could do other things, better,
more suited to her temperament and ideals.  She
would endure this place only so long as she must, and
at the first opportunity of a better position, leave it.
Tired, but glad that for the immediate future at
least she need not worry about the fewness of the
pennies in her savings box, Marie slipped on her coat,
and clinging to old Schultz's arm, trudged happily
home.
</p>

<p>
After a few days, her shyness partly left her, she
was more at ease, more sure of herself and the
approval of her personality and singing was even more
marked.  The first time, the room had only been a
blur.  Her self-consciousness had made it impossible
for her to note more than a vague outline, but now
that the tension had relaxed somewhat, she was able
to distinguish the details of her surroundings.  She
began to see here and there a beckoning finger that
called her hospitably to share its owner's table.
Sometimes she saw the angry frown and quick proprietory
nudge of the woman who accompanied him and resented
his interest in the little singer.  She began to
hear her name called in a familiar diminutive, as
groups of students would ask for favorite songs.
Secure under the shelter of Herr Schultz's wing, she
smiled her thanks from the platform.
</p>

<p>
One night, she stood wrapped in her cloak, waiting
for her guardian as he gathered up his music.  The
last guest was leaving beerily, and the greasy waiters
were going about turning out the lights and mopping
up the splashed tables.
</p>

<p>
Brower came heavily up to the platform.  He
looked at Marie with an unpleasant grin.
</p>

<p>
"Tired, Fräulein?" he asked, "never mind, you'll
be home in a little while.  You've done very well!
But to-morrow, I want you to be nice to my friends."
</p>

<p>
Herr Schultz, without turning, stopped in his task
of gathering the sheets of music, and the proprietor
went on.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow I want you to pay a few visits among
the tables.  Remember, the more we sell to drink, the
more you are worth to me."
</p>

<p>
Schultz turned quickly, his heavy eyebrows drawn
together in a frown, his weak mouth working
tremulously.
</p>

<p>
"The Fräulein is only here to sing," he said, his
voice shaking, "she does not go down among the
tables."
</p>

<p>
"What have you got to say?" thundered Brower,
"If you don't like the way this place is run, you can
go!  There are plenty of piano-players!"
</p>

<p>
Marie looked on in terror, only half understanding.
Her face went white as she realized what this would
mean.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she begged, "if he goes I must go."
</p>

<p>
This was not what Brower wanted.  The girl had
really been a profitable investment.  His clientele was
pleased.  New people were beginning to come.  More
money was being spent.  Allowances must be made.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Schultz," he growled, "everything will
be all right, she needn't drink, I only want her to go
about and be pleasant.  You're here where you can
watch her."
</p>

<p>
In Schultz's faithful breast, the knowledge of what
it would mean at his age, to lose his position,
struggled with his fear for Marie.  Brower was right,
there were so many piano-players, but he knew well
what this sort of thing led to.  He had seen it so
often.
</p>

<p>
"She can't go down among the tables," he repeated
doggedly.
</p>

<p>
Brower struggled between rage and cupidity.  He
would gladly have kicked the old man into the street,
but the source of income which the girl meant, must
not be lost.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he shrugged, and for the time, the
matter was dropped.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
One night, as she waited between songs, Marie let
her eyes wander about the smoke-filled room and
wondered, as she heard the occasional bursts of
laughter, if these people who came here voluntarily were
really enjoying life.  She wondered if this meant
happiness to them.
</p>

<p>
The ideas of right and wrong which had been
learned in the convent and at home with her father,
seemed so absolutely apart from what surrounded her
now, that she had not even a means of comparison.
This was simply different.
</p>

<p>
The young officer over whose boot she had stumbled
that first night, was sitting sullenly at the table near
her, and her glance wandered from him to the man
at his elbow, the same who had reprimanded him
for his rudeness.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall, thin man, older than the boy at his
side, and wore the handsome uniform of a captain of
cavalry.  She was impressed by the straight, unbending
attitude of his shoulders.  The thin, hard mouth
of the supersensualist somehow frightened her,
although she was too inexperienced to know why.  She
was trying to analyze this fear, this aversion for a
stranger, when she became conscious that he was
staring at her, and for a moment she stared back
fascinated into the brilliant eyes that held her own
even against her will.  With an effort, she turned
away hastily, and busied herself with the piece of
music she was holding.
</p>

<p>
Several times during the evening, she was conscious
of those magnetic eyes which she avoided with a
curious flutter at her heart.  She had taken her seat
beside the piano, when she saw Brower standing at
the edge of the platform, beckoning to her.
</p>

<p>
Hesitatingly, she rose and went to him.
</p>

<p>
"Fräulein," he said with his oily smile, "my wife
is here with some friends.  We want you to join us
for a little while."
</p>

<p>
Schultz swung around on the piano stool.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
Brower shot him a glance charged with venom, a
burst of rage trembling on his lips, which he
controlled with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter?" he growled.  "My wife wants
to meet her.  Anything wrong with that?"
</p>

<p>
There was the look in Schultz's eyes of a faithful
dog which cannot express the love it feels.
</p>

<p>
"She should not&mdash;&mdash;" he began, "she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Brower turned to Marie.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you want to come, Fräulein?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The girl was pathetically eager to give a sufficient
measure of service for the compensation she received.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," she said, timidly.
</p>

<p>
Brower's wife was a large, boldly handsome woman
of about thirty-five.  She had been a very pretty
girl, and in spite of the artificial yellow of her
carefully dressed hair, the over-red of her lips, the paint
on her cheeks, she still bore some traces of her
vanished beauty.  She blazed with jewels which were
obviously not all that their glitter proclaimed.  To
the observer it was very apparent that everything
about her was a sham.  It was even whispered that
her marriage came under the same heading.
</p>

<p>
She greeted Marie with an over-effusiveness.
</p>

<p>
"Do sit down, <i>Liebchen</i>.  My friends all like your
singing so much."  With a wave of her plump,
bejeweled hand, she introduced the others at her table.
"Herr Kranz, meet Fräulein Helmar; Herr Schnitzer,
Fräulein Pragt."
</p>

<p>
Marie slipped into the chair Brower pulled out
for her.
</p>

<p>
"I certainly like your singing, Fräulein," boomed
Herr Kranz, in a voice that Marie felt certain must
penetrate to every corner of the room; "but I like
you better," and he smiled a broad smile, that lifted
his heavy black mustache and showed an uneven row
of discolored teeth.  His prominent eyes took in her
slender prettiness with an evident relish, and his thick
bull-neck settled consciously into his collar as he
pulled down a brilliant vest over his round paunch.
</p>

<p>
The other man who had been introduced as Herr
Schnitzer, was stoop-shouldered and pale haired.  His
prominent Adam's apple slid up and down grotesquely
as he ate the cheese sandwich that was
before him.
</p>

<p>
"We like little blond singers," he said with his
mouth full, but his eyes were fixed fatuously on
Fräulein Pragt who simpered coyly.  She was over-dressed,
and over-plump, her empty, common face shone fair
and bland, and her silly little red mouth was
always half open.
</p>

<p>
Marie looked from one to the other with a feeling
half of disgust, and half of pride in herself that she
was different.
</p>

<p>
Brower patted her familiarly on the shoulder as
he hailed a passing waiter.
</p>

<p>
"Fritz, bring Fräulein Helmar a sandwich and
some beer," and he moved away to another table.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing for me, please," began Marie.
</p>

<p>
"Come, <i>Herzchen</i>, just a little something!  One
glass of beer," urged her hostess.
</p>

<p>
"I don't wish anything, thank you," said Marie,
with quiet finality.
</p>

<p>
Frau Brower laughed loudly.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you're so thin," she said, "a little more
flesh on your bones wouldn't hurt you, Fräulein."
</p>

<p>
Kranz leaned toward her admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"You're young yet," he said, "you'll be just right
in a year or so," and he put a moist hand over hers.
</p>

<p>
Marie shrank away, and Frau Brower laughed
again offensively.
</p>

<p>
"She should have a sweetheart, Kranz, that's what
she needs," she said.  "Have you got one, <i>Liebchen</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's face flushed.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said.
</p>

<p>
There was something about this girl's manner Frau
Brower resented.  She experienced the feeling all
women of her type do, in the presence of one who is
everything they are not.  What right had she, a little
singer in Brewer's café, to give herself airs?  She'd
put her in her proper place.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you get one?" she sneered.
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted her head proudly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe I want one," she said simply.  "I'm
here to sing, I haven't time for anything else!"
</p>

<p>
Kranz was eyeing her with open admiration, his
prominent, dull eyes, looking ludicrously like a fish's.
The other two were deep in a conversation that
consisted mainly of guttural monosyllables from
Schnitzer and conscious giggles from Fräulein Pragt.
</p>

<p>
Frau Brower looked at her insolently.
</p>

<p>
"I advise you to drop that stand-offish manner.
It won't pay here.  A <i>fesches Mädel</i> like you ought to
have a dozen lovers!  I'm going to bring a friend
around to meet you!"
</p>

<p>
Marie flushed at the open coarseness in her voice.
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, but I'd rather not meet anyone," she
said.  "Herr Schultz takes me home every evening.
He doesn't like me to meet strangers.  I don't want
to do anything to offend him."
</p>

<p>
This time the laughter was general.
</p>

<p>
"What do you care what that old fossil says?"
began Frau Brower, and her husband, who had joined
them again, frowned darkly as he looked toward the
platform.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he growled, "what's this?  Am I
paying you to be a fine lady?  Do you think you're
an opera singer?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's lips trembled.  She rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Please," she faltered, "I&mdash;I think I'd better go
back."  She was looking into Brewer's scowling face.
She saw his eyes shift, and suddenly, a great change
came over him.  His anger seemed to vanish almost
by magic, and an oily smile spread over his features.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Fräulein," he said, and she thought
she saw him glance warningly at his wife, "we will
excuse you if you want to go."
</p>

<p>
Marie turned to see the cause for this sudden
change, and found herself looking straight into the
burning eyes of the man who once before had come
to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
He bowed slightly, with a smile that was so
encouraging that the girl knew instinctively she owed
Brewer's change of front to his interference.
Trembling, she started back to the platform, the Captain
standing aside and bowing his acknowledgment of
her timid smile of thanks.
</p>

<p>
This man with his polished manner, his fine
carriage, his trim uniform was more like the men she
had met at her father's home, more her own class.
His thin, aquiline face had smiled on her with what,
in her ignorance of the world, she took to be kindly,
fraternal interest.
</p>

<p>
Frau Brower, meanwhile, had watched this little
by-play.  Her face reddened under its coat of rouge.
</p>

<p>
"Brower," she choked, "are you going to be
browbeaten in your own café?"
</p>

<p>
Her husband tried to stop her, a curious look of
fear coming into his eyes as he glanced hurriedly at
the Captain's table, but she went on angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you master in your own house?  I wouldn't
be ordered around by any&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The man put a heavy hand on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Halt's Maul</i>, you fool," he said.  "You don't know
what you're saying, he's&mdash;&mdash;"  He bent and whispered
something in her ear.  What he said had the
effect of instantly dissipating her wrath, and she,
too, turned and glanced fearfully in the direction
of the tall officer.
</p>

<p>
Brower swore under his breath and turned heavily
away, leaving the others to comfort his spouse.
</p>

<p>
This was the beginning of Marie's visits among the
tables.  Once, Brower called her to explain one of
her songs to a "particular friend" of his.  Another
time, she must go and ask some officers what they
wanted her to sing next.  Schultz, with a heavy heart
had to let her go.
</p>

<p>
The Captain, whose friendly smile had struck an
answering note in her heart, came sometimes three
or four nights consecutively.  Then, perhaps a week
or ten days would elapse during which Marie looked
in vain for the tall, lean figure.  She forgot her vague
fears of his cruel mouth anl brilliant eyes.  Her heart
was so sore and lonely in this unaccustomed place
that it was a disappointment to her when she missed
him.  She had a curious sense of protection and
security whenever the bright note of his uniform
came through the green swinging-door, and he made
his way to his usual table.
</p>

<p>
There was an undefinable air of reticence, a touch
of the mystic about him, which aroused a feeling of
interested curiosity in the girl's heart.
</p>

<p>
As she waited between songs, her naturally active
mind amused itself by trying to read the different
faces she saw before her.  This man was the only one
of whom she could form no conception.  All the
others were obviously what they were, he alone was
different.  And because it is the unknown which
attracts, and because he had on several instances
shielded her from rudeness, she began to think of him
as a friend.
</p>

<p>
There was no one to point out to her that the
brilliant eyes were cold and calculating, that the lines
about the thin mouth and between his brows, were
those experience writes.  There was no one to tell her
that this face which seemed to smile so kindly into
hers, was that of a man who knows his ability to
judge and compare the values of sophistication and
inexperience, and who has used this knowledge for
the domination and destruction of those weaker than
himself.
</p>

<p>
One evening as she sat watching him, he glanced
about the room in a coldly speculative fashion, as
one who sees a vision that includes those about him.
If she were privileged to see the picture in his mind
she would have seen the gay uniforms about her
changed into a dull gray, the jauntily set caps
replaced by spiked helmets.  A cold smile played
about the thin lips, and his hand resting on the table
unconsciously clinched as though it grasped the hilt
of a sword.  But she saw only the smile and not its
meaning.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, she began under Brower's careful
maneuvering, to go about among the tables.  At first,
her visits were very brief, but sometimes, some
particular friend of the proprietor's detained her longer.
On these occasions there was much laughter, jokes
whose point she did not always see, and many rather
rough compliments, but on the whole, nothing that
offended her.  Brower had seen to that.  He knew
that the watchful eyes of the old pianist followed
Marie about the room, and it suited his purpose to
see that both his fears and hers should be laid to rest.
</p>

<p>
To the Captain's table, however, she was never
invited.  There was only the friendly nod in passing,
the kindly smile that said, "I know; I understand
how out of place you are here, how different you are
from the rest!"
</p>

<p>
And old Schultz, seeing the flutter in the laces of
the girl's breast when the Captain came in, watching
the flush on her cheek, when their eyes met, noting
too, with a pang in his heart, the evident disappointment
when he failed to appear, shook his head sadly.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Marie stood a moment at the door of her little
dressing-room, before running the gauntlet between
its shelter and the platform, where, through the
wreaths of smoke, she could see old Schultz's thick
shoulders hunched over the piano keys.  Familiarity
had not begotten any feeling of comfort or tolerance
for the conditions of this cheap, tawdry place.  She
hated the timbered walls with the trite phrases
stenciled on them in black letters, the bare tables with
rings, left by many steins, indelibly stamped on them,
the shrill-voiced women, the men.  She hated it all.
But one must live.
</p>

<p>
Her rent at the Schultz's must be paid.  They had
scarcely enough for themselves.  Her thoughts
reverted to the one pleasant memory, the tall officer
who had intervened between her and the insults of
Frau Brower.
</p>

<p>
She had been made painfully conscious of the
woman's enmity, which was shown in a score of ways,
and left her wondering what the next annoyance
would be.
</p>

<p>
In a far corner, she suddenly caught a glimpse of
the man of whom she had been thinking.  He was
engaged in earnest conversation with the proprietor.
His face was black, his jaw angrily set, and he was
emphatically pounding the palm of one hand with
the fist of the other.  Brower, unlike his usual
truculent self, was listening in a meek, half-frightened
way.
</p>

<p>
Who was this man, she wondered?  What was he?
Had he a permanent place in her life, or would he too,
disappear into the darkness where so much that she
had known had vanished?
</p>

<p>
She saw him turn from the door, and make his way
to the table that was always reserved for him.  She
peered through the swinging smoke wreaths.  Her
eyes brightened as she watched him.  His square,
thin shoulders stooped a little as he took his seat,
and in a moment he was in deep conversation with
the same young lieutenant, who was always with him.
His presence gave her a certain feeling of pleasure,
though what it was, or why she felt it, it would have
been difficult for her to define.  She walked swiftly
between the tables and mounted the platform.
</p>

<p>
After his courteous intervention in her behalf, she
had reproached herself for the feeling of distrust that
she had when she first saw him.  The graying hair
at his temples, increased her confidence, she could
see it quite plainly from where she stood at the side
of the piano.  She found herself hoping that he would
look in her direction, and was pleased when he turned
from his companion and nodded cheerfully to her.
</p>

<p>
The pale-faced violinist whispered to her as she
sorted her music.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain bows, Fräulein, that is nice, yes?"
</p>

<p>
She could not tell why she resented the tone, and
gave no answer, but she was conscious of being
disappointed when for a long time he paid no more
attention to her.  There were other beckoning fingers,
however, other welcoming smiles, and Brower was
always near to see that she was "nice to his friends,"
and being "nice to his friends" meant sometimes being
obliged to sit at the tables and smiling at people
she loathed.  But no matter how her soul revolted at
her task, she was always comforted when she could
meet across the room, the brilliant eyes that held a
smile for her, and seemed to say, "Never mind, I am
here!  And I am your friend!"
</p>

<p>
While he was there, she was sure of her songs being
appreciated, for, although the Captain did not deign
to applaud, Franz did and then curiously enough
seemed to forget her.
</p>

<p>
The two men were always together.  Sometimes
they came in late, sometimes, they would be at their
table when Marie arrived and would stay just long
enough to hear one song.  She noticed the deference
the proprietor paid to them.
</p>

<p>
In some intangible way, the Captain managed to
stamp himself upon her consciousness as her champion,
unnoticeably to others, but plainly visible to
the girl, whose horizon was so empty of anyone to
whom she could turn for help or understanding.  His
methods were those of the man who understands
women well enough to know that in order to achieve
his ends, he must be as nearly as possible like the
personality admired by the particular woman, in
whom he is, for the moment, interested.  But to
Marie, sick of the coarse brutality about her, revolted
by the covert insults that she only half understood,
he seemed the personification of chivalry and
thoughtfulness.
</p>

<p>
She was particularly grateful for his protection
against the rough, boisterous men upon whom it was
part of her task to smile.  Various little incidents in
which he proved his wish to protect and befriend her,
were treasured in her memory.
</p>

<p>
One night, the fat man, whose cascading chin had
so revolted her the first time she sang, called her to
his table, and afraid to disobey, lest Brower should
be angry, Marie accepted his invitation.
</p>

<p>
"You're a nice little girl," he wheezed, putting his
flabby hand with its flashing diamond, over hers.
"We'll have a bottle of real wine together, not beer,
like the rest of these," indicating with his thumb the
drinking students.  "You and I are going to be
friends, and we're going to enjoy ourselves."  He
smelled horribly of beer and tobacco smoke, and Marie
tried to draw her hand away, but he leaned heavily
forward and tilted her chin up to him with a thick
forefinger.  "You're a little thin," he appraised, "but
I like them like that!"
</p>

<p>
Marie drew away, frightened, when suddenly
Brower tapped her tormentor on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain wants the Fräulein to sing another
song before he goes.  You will excuse her, yes?"
</p>

<p>
The fat man's face turned almost purple and he
muttered an oath under his breath, but he drew back,
and Marie, her heart rejoicing at the authority of her
champion, hurried to the platform, smiling gratefully
as she passed his table.
</p>

<p>
This might have been an accident, but it happened
again and again.  Each time some noisy student or
boisterous young officer progressed too far in his
attentions to her, Marie was sure of some subtle
interference from the Captain that would put a stop to
the insults and unkindness which, without realizing
why, she knew meant some terrible danger to her.
</p>

<p>
Gradually and almost imperceptibly, his strong
mind and dominant personality took hold of her
naturally clinging nature.  He seemed so much older,
that to her inexperience, it was as though her father
were watching over her, and she gave him the gratitude
and admiration a child might give.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, during the long days, as she bent over
her sewing with Frau Schultz, his dark profile rose
before her eyes, his quick smile flashed across her
vision, and at night, when she brushed her yellow
hair by the little window, trying to shake out in the
faint breeze, the heavy scent of tobacco, which clung
to it, she would remember gratefully how he had
averted again some unpleasantness.
</p>

<p>
But no matter from what angle she viewed his
attitude toward herself, she could find nothing that
seemed to warrant the faintly indefinite sense of
danger of which she was vaguely conscious, and which she
tried to reason away.
</p>

<p>
One night, a greasy waiter came to the door of her
dressing-room with a twisted tissue paper parcel in
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"The Captain sends these, Fräulein," he mumbled,
and shuffled off, leaving the parcel on a chair.  Marie
unfolded the wrappings and found two lovely roses,
dewy and fragrant.  She adored flowers.  It was long
since she had seen any excepting through the glass of
some florist's window, and she pressed her flushed
cheek against their cool petals.  Her father had
seldom gone for his feeble walk without bringing her
one or two blossoms on his return, and the memory
brought the ready tears to her eyes.
</p>

<p>
How good this man was, she thought, as she pinned
the flowers in among the white laces of her blouse.
In every woman's heart there is the inherent desire
for masculine admiration.  Little convent-bred Marie
was innocent of any thoughts of coquetry.  She only
felt the natural pleasure that youth does when it is
noticed and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Old Schultz shook his head when she showed him
the two roses nestling against her breast, but there
was no time for comment.  The smile Marie sent
toward the Captain's table, was a very bright one,
and the young Lieutenant nudged his companion as
he noticed it, but he was answered by so forbidding
a frown, that he took refuge in his mug of beer.
</p>

<p>
Marie sang well that night.  The clear, sweet voice
held a note of joyousness, missing before.  Deep in
her heart, was the hope that the Captain might send
the greasy waiter with a message asking her to step
down to his table for a minute or so, but no message
came, and to her disappointment, just after her first
song, the Captain and his young friend pushed back
their chairs and left.
</p>

<p>
Who was this man, she wondered, for the hundredth
time.  Everybody in the "Two Eagles," she
had noticed, paid him marked deference.  Once or
twice before, she had seen him leave abruptly when
some orderly had come in quietly and touched him
on the shoulder.  What was his place in this world of
which she was beginning to see so many sides?
</p>

<p>
On the way home that night, old Schultz for the
first time, was cross.  He only grumbled when Marie
tried to talk about the roses she was so carefully
guarding from the cold, under her coat.  He growled
something about no good coming from such things,
but she scarcely heard him.  Her feet tripped along,
two steps to each of his, her heart full of gratitude
for the kindness that had been shown her.
</p>

<p>
When she was in her own little room, she put the
blossoms tenderly in one of the painted mugs that
adorned her bureau, and began slipping quickly out
of her white frock.  As it fell about her feet in a soft,
shapeless heap, Frau Schultz came in.
</p>

<p>
"Fräulein," she said, "Shatzi tells me that Captain
Von Pfaffen gave you some flowers to-night."
</p>

<p>
Marie stepped out of her dress and hung it carefully
in the clothes press.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen, so that was his name!
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she smiled, "two lovely roses!  Oh, Frau
Schultz, that was just what my father used to do.
Sometimes it was one lily, sometimes a spray of
hyacinths, sometimes a rose.  It made me think of my
father!"
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes were moist and Frau Schultz kissed
the girl tenderly as she bade her good-night.
</p>

<p>
"Shatzi," she told her husband later, as arrayed
in carpet slippers and a tattered dressing-gown he
sat smoking a good-night pipe, "Shatzi, there is no
cause to worry, the girl is still only a child, she is
grateful for something her father would have done
for her.  You must not suspect everybody!" and she
vigorously pounded the already plump pillows of the
mountainous connubial couch before climbing into it.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Marie began to sing only for one table, for the
one pair of ears for whose appreciation she cared.
Love had not entered her thoughts, only a deep
interest.  This man was so unlike the others who
frequented the "Two Eagles."  His stern face that
could break into a smile for her, the lines about his
thin mouth, the graying hair, his straight military
shoulders, all meant to the girl the protection she
might have had from her father.  She would have
laughed had she known the thoughts that were worrying
the good people with whom she lived.
</p>

<p>
The fact, however, that some one was interested in
her, brought more color into her cheeks, more vivacity
into her manner.  She was developing, the lines of
her figure were rounder.  She was more mature.  The
promise of fair young womanhood was beginning to
be fulfilled, so that now as she hurried along the short
aisle between her dressing-room and the platform,
more eyes followed her, more hands were stretched out
to detain her.  Brower was pleased with his
investment.
</p>

<p>
One night she left the platform earlier than usual.
The Captain and his companion had already gone,
and she whispered to old Schultz that she would wait
for him in her dressing-room.  Once in the shelter of
its dirty walls, she pinned on her hat, threw her cloak
about her and sat down till the old man should be
ready to come for her.  She leaned her elbows on the
board which served as a dressing-table and looked at
herself in the square of looking-glass that hung above
it.  It was cracked and splotched with mildew, and
the light of the one gas jet flickered and marked
queer shadows under her eyes and chin.  But even so,
she smiled at the pleasing image that smiled back
at her.
</p>

<p>
The opening of the door startled her, and turning,
she found herself facing Brower.  The proprietor
of the "Two Eagles" had never entered the little
room before.  Her heart sank.  Was he coming to tell
her she was not needed?
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;&mdash;" she began, but Brower stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't get frightened, <i>Kleine</i>.  I didn't come to
tell you I thought I could get along without you."  His
voice was thick, and his coarse face redder than
usual.  He leered at her with his small, swinish eyes.
She saw that he had been drinking heavily.  "You're
looking prettier these days, and I think I'll stretch a
point and let you have an extra krone if you want it.
Now, who says I'm not kind-hearted, eh?  Come,
little one, give me a kiss!" and before the girl quite
realized what he was doing, he had grabbed her by
the shoulders and planted a rough kiss on her cheek.
</p>

<p>
Marie screamed and pushed him from her with all
her force.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you?" she gasped.  "How dare you?"
</p>

<p>
Brower chuckled.  "You're prettier when you're
mad!  Gott!  I think I'll have another!" but as he
started toward her, the girl struck him full in the
face with her little clenched fist and ran from the
room.
</p>

<p>
The indignity of it, the horrible feel of his flabby
lips against her cheek, made her shudder as at the
touch of some loathsome reptile.  She ran sobbing
through the passage, but just as she was about to
open the door and go out into the street, a hand was
laid on her arm.
</p>

<p>
She shrank back, shivering into the shadow, but as
she turned, she found herself face to face with the
Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Fräulein," he said, "what is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
Marie hid her face against his coat sleeve as a child
might have done.
</p>

<p>
"He kissed me," she sobbed, "the awful creature!"
</p>

<p>
"Who?" his low voice shook with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Brower!  I was waiting for Schultz to take me
home, he came into the room and kissed me!  It was
horrible!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen started down the passage.
</p>

<p>
"I'll settle with him," he raged, but Marie caught
at his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Please," she whispered frightened, "please!" and
he turned and patted her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he said, "I'll see him later.  Come, let
me take you home," and with gentle fingers, he
fastened her coat collar about her throat, and before
Marie realized it, he had swept her into a <i>fiakre</i> and
they were whirling away.
</p>

<p>
The thought of this man's kindness to her overwhelmed
her again, and she huddled into her corner
crying as though her heart would break.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Fräulein," urged her companion, "you
really mustn't.  I'll see that the brute is punished.
You mustn't cry so," and he put a protecting arm
about her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Marie sobbed against the rough cloth of his heavy
military coat.  All the sorrow and struggle, all the
misery of the past months seemed to pour from her
heart, but presently, mingled with the rumble of the
wheels, she seemed to hear the query, "where are you
going?"
</p>

<p>
She straightened herself suddenly and her companion
made no effort to detain her.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't even asked me where I live," she said,
surprise quieting her sobs.  "Where are you taking me?"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen drew her against his shoulder again.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would tell me when you were calmer,"
he said.  "In the meantime, it is early; we're here at
my place.  Come in for a minute.  You are frightened
and nervous.  Come in, my old housekeeper will make
you a cup of coffee, and by the time old Schultz
reaches home, you'll be there too."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," began Marie, "Frau Schultz will be worried,
I can't," but the brakes were already jerking
against the wheels and in another second the <i>fiakre</i>
had drawn up in front of a brown-stone apartment
house.
</p>

<p>
"I can't, they'll worry," and Marie drew back in
the shelter of the cab as Von Pfaffen stepped onto the
sidewalk and held out his hand to help her alight.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," he assured her, "I'll telephone the
'Two Eagles' as soon as we get in and have them tell
Schultz.  Come, Fräulein, just a cup of coffee."
</p>

<p>
His arm steadied her across the icy pavement, and
the warmth of the apartment hall was comforting,
but Marie stepped into the lift with a beating heart.
</p>

<p>
Was this wrong, she asked herself?  Would her
father have approved?  But the wonder of it all soon
dulled the still small voice that spoke again of that
vague sense of danger, and she entered the hallway
as Von Pfaffen stood aside before the door he had
just opened.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked about her curiously.  So this was
where he lived.  It was a comfortable apartment, a
peculiar mixture of severity and luxury.  The great
easy chair that held out inviting arms before a bright
fire burning in the great <i>kachelofen</i>, and the long
bare table with its litter of official-looking papers,
contrasted curiously.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen rang the bell and an old woman came
in.  Marie instinctively disliked her face, with its
pendulous nose and the heavy blue-veined cheeks, but
she seemed kindly and the girl was ashamed of her
aversion.
</p>

<p>
"Coffee, Lena," ordered the Captain, and with a
peculiar flat-footed shuffle, the old woman turned and
left the room.
</p>

<p>
"She was my nurse when I was a child," said Von
Pfaffen, and Marie looked after the ungainly form
with a new interest.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'm ashamed to be giving you all this trouble,"
she stammered, as he helped her out of her coat; "but
I couldn't stay there, could I?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed you couldn't, child.  Now you must forget
all about it.  I'm glad it was I who chanced to find
you before that beast could do you further harm.
To-morrow I shall crush him like a fly!"
</p>

<p>
"You and the Schultzes are all the friends I
have."  She looked up at him gratefully.  "There isn't
anyone else in all the world."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen took the little hand and patted it.
</p>

<p>
"There, there," he smiled, "three friends are a
great many to have in this world, don't you think?"
and he settled her comfortably into one of the big
arm-chairs before the fire.
</p>

<p>
After a little, Lena waddled in, preceded by an
appetizing aroma of coffee.  She carried a tray on
which she had set out a shining urn and a dish of
cakes, and pushing aside the scattered papers on the
littered table, she made room for her burden.
</p>

<p>
"Is everything well, Lena?" asked her master.
</p>

<p>
The old woman grunted and shuffled out, closing
the door after her.
</p>

<p>
"She's not very friendly," apologized Von Pfaffen,
"but she takes advantage of having been with me
nearly all my life, and besides, she lends an air of
respectability to my bachelor establishment."
</p>

<p>
Marie smiled because he did.  It was good to be
here in this handsomely furnished apartment, warm
and cozy, and with this man, whom she so much admired,
beside her.  She sipped her coffee luxuriantly
and nibbled one of the little cakes.
</p>

<p>
"I'll telephone that you're safe with me, Fräulein,"
he said, and rose and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Marie looked about her.  How wonderful Fate was,
she mused.  If it hadn't been for that horrible Brower,
she would not have been here now.  The unwonted
warmth lulled her.  The love of comfort and luxury
was strong in her.  Her father had catered to it.  It
had been his happiness to see how readily she had
given up the austerity of the convent and revelled
in the almost sybaritic ease with which he loved to
surround her.  She snuggled down into the embrace
of the great easy chair with a sigh of content.
</p>

<p>
This was what her home had been like that short
year with her father, and the thought of that and the
intervening months with their bitter struggle, sent
the slow tears down her cheeks again.  She had not
time to brush them away when her host entered.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Fräulein," he said.  "Schultz came
to the phone himself.  I told him I'd bring you home
later.  What?  You're not crying again?  Fräulein,
I call that unkind, when I'm trying to do all I can
for you."
</p>

<p>
"I know you are," there was a catch in Marie's
voice.  "I'm not going to cry any more."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," and Von Pfaffen drew his chair up
beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Now, let's have a talk.  I've wanted to, ever since
I first saw you at the 'Two Eagles.'"
</p>

<p>
"How wonderful that you should even have noticed
me!"  Marie was unconscious of any coquetry.  It
was wonderful to hear that this resplendent being
should have picked her out for notice.
</p>

<p>
The Captain leaned over and took one of her
hands in his.
</p>

<p>
"What a pretty little hand," he said.  "What a
pity it has had to work so hard.  All these rough
places," and suddenly he raised her fingers to his lips.
</p>

<p>
Marie was startled, but at her involuntary movement,
he dropped her hand and turned again to the
fire.
</p>

<p>
"Warm enough here?" he asked, so paternally,
that the girl was ashamed of her vague fears.  But
somewhere in the distance she heard a clock striking
the hour.
</p>

<p>
"It must be getting late, Herr Captain," she faltered,
"I think I'd better go," and with a half sigh
for the comfort about her, she rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
The man rose, too, hastily, and put his hands on
her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Just a little longer, Fräulein," he begged, "I've
thought so often of you sitting here as you are now."
</p>

<p>
His face frightened Marie.  The warmth of his
hands burning through the shoulders of her thin gown
made her uneasy.  His eyes seemed bloodshot in the
firelight, and a vein in his forehead suddenly stood
out like a cord.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Captain, let me go," whispered the girl.
"I must go."
</p>

<p>
"No!"  His voice shook, "no, little one, you're here
and you're mine," and before she really knew what
was happening, she found herself crushed against his
breast, powerless to struggle, a great dizziness
sweeping over her.  She seemed to lose all sense of
everything excepting that from somewhere immeasurably
above her, his mouth drew nearer, and nearer, till it
folded over her own in a stifling kiss.
</p>

<p>
After what seemed an interminable time, consciousness
came back to her, power to struggle, and with
the strength of youth, she freed herself from his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go," she panted, "let me go," and blindly
she flung herself against the door that stood behind
her.  Where it led, she did not know, she only knew
that she must get away, away from this man as she
had run away from the other.
</p>

<p>
Slipping into the room beyond, she threw herself
against the door, striving with desperate force to
hold it against the man on the other side.  She had
only time to realize that she had flung herself into
his bedroom for shelter, when the door yielded, and
she cowered into a corner.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen came toward her, his voice thick and
unsteady.  The vein in his forehead beating, his eyes,
even away from the firelight, were bloodshot.
</p>

<p>
"Little one," he whispered, "you're not going to
shut me out&mdash;to-night!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
The huntsman had successfully stalked the doe.
With the ingenuity and skill of long experience he
had brought her to bay.  The trophy won, he had
gone, leaving his victim suffering and alone, with a
wound that time might heal, but a scar that could
never be effaced.
</p>

<p>
When Marie roused herself from the stupor in
which she had lain, the room was flooded with
sunlight.  She sat up slowly.  Her head throbbed with
a splitting pain, her eyeballs burned.  She was sick
with revolt and terror.  This man, whom she had
trusted, whom she had thought was her friend, was
worse than those from whom he had seemed to protect
her.  One more veil was torn brutally away from
her eyes, and the world stared back at her, gaunt,
ugly, grim, and altogether pitiless.  Phrases heard
at the convent, kept repeating themselves over and
over in her brain.  What would her father have said
could he have known?  How could she explain her
absence to the Schultzes?  How could she face them
again?  That such a thing as this could have
happened to her!
</p>

<p>
"I'll kill myself!" she sobbed.  "I want to die!"
</p>

<p>
After awhile, old Lena shuffled in with breakfast
on a tray, her ugly, wooden face, as expressionless
as a carven image, her wicked old eyes shifting about
the room.  The girl buried her head deeper in the
pillows.
</p>

<p>
"Let me alone!" she cried.  "Let me alone!  I
want to die!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool!" she said unsympathetically.
"What did you come here for?" and setting the tray
down, she left her to weep out her horror and remorse
alone.
</p>

<p>
For a long time she lay convulsed with sobs.  Then
the natural reaction of youth and perfect health
reasserted itself.  She gradually grew quiet.  The
courage that had made it possible for her to face so
many trying experiences in the past year, came to
her rescue.
</p>

<p>
The thing had happened.  There was no going
back.  She must face it as best she could.
</p>

<p>
Later, her hat pinned on securely, her cloak
wrapped about her, she opened the door and went into
the library.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen was sitting in the great easy chair by
the fire, evidently waiting for her.  He rose as she
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, little one&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but stopped as he
saw that she was dressed for the street.
</p>

<p>
Marie looked at him dully.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going!"
</p>

<p>
He laid a gentle hand on her shoulder and smiled
into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Where?"  The slight note of sarcasm did not
escape her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," her voice was almost a whisper,
her lips trembled pitifully.
</p>

<p>
He bent over her with a smile.  His long arm drew
her close to him.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart," he said softly, "don't be frightened.
I love you.  You are all mine now."
</p>

<p>
The girl tried to draw away from him, crying
aloud her bitterness, but with the strength that she
could not battle against, Von Pfaffen held her firmly
against his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Little one," he whispered, "there is nothing to cry
about.  I love you!  As soon as I can arrange my
affairs, we'll be married.  Everything will be well."
</p>

<p>
But Marie sobbed with long dry sobs that tore at
her throat.  How could she face the Schultzes?  How
could she go back to the "Two Eagles" even if they
would take her in?  Where was she to go?  What was
to become of her?
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen soothed and patted her.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to worry about, <i>Liebchen</i>," he
whispered.  "Don't you trust me?"  His brilliant eyes
softened into almost sincerity.  "The Schultzes will
probably not take you in, besides, your place is here
with me."
</p>

<p>
Marie's breath caught in her throat and she shrank
away from him.
</p>

<p>
"No," she stammered, "no&mdash;please!  You must
let me go!"
</p>

<p>
"But where?" and in her heart the girl echoed his
words.
</p>

<p>
"Where!"
</p>

<p>
Quick to see his advantage, he put his hands on
her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Now listen, I love you!  I want you!  As soon as
my affairs are adjusted, as soon as the work I'm
engaged in is finished," and he pointed to the pile of
papers on the long table, "you and I will be married!"
</p>

<p>
Her trembling hands grasped his coat lapels.  She
shook at them desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Marry me now," she begged, "marry me now!
What would the nuns say&mdash;my father&mdash;Frau
Schultz?  Marry me now!  You must!"
</p>

<p>
He drew her cheek against his own.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, little one," he whispered, "don't worry.
There are reasons why I can't arrange things now.
Everything will be all right.  Can't you trust me?"  His
eyes smiled into hers, the lines about his mouth
were softened, gentle.  There was no suggestion of
the terrible creature against whom she had tried to
bar her door.
</p>

<p>
The power of his dominant personality over-awed
her.  She wanted so to trust him.
</p>

<p>
"But what am I to do?" she faltered.  "Where am
I to go?"
</p>

<p>
"You are not going anywhere.  You are going to
stay here with me, sheltered, taken care of, protected,
as I shall protect you, until we can be married.  You
don't want to leave me, do you?" and in spite of her
grief, the warning voice of her conscience, Marie
thought of the "Two Eagles," of the swinging
wreaths of tobacco smoke, the heavy, fetid air, the
leers of the half-drunken students, which she seemed
suddenly to understand.  She felt again the flabby,
sticky kiss of Brower against her cheek, and
shuddered as she thought what that, too, might have
meant.  To go back to the "Two Eagles" was
impossible, even if Brower would have taken her, after the
blow she had given him, and the Schultzes&mdash;the
Schultzes would never let her in again.  She looked
about her half stupidly.  The fire crackled comfortably
in the stove.  The room, in spite of its incongruity,
was such a room as her father had taught
her to love.  This man beside her was, after all, one
of her own class.
</p>

<p>
Through her thoughts, she could hear his voice
saying again, softly, kindly, with that subtle charm
that held such fascination for her: "You will stay,
little one?  You don't want to leave me, when I love
you so!  We'll be married as soon as I can arrange it.
Trust me.  Little hands like these were never meant
to work.  Little feet like these should be cased in
satin.  Let me give you everything, anything!
Sweetheart, sweetheart, you don't want to leave me!
You can't!"

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
The days that followed were like a dream to Marie.
At first there were tears and misgivings.  Wonderment
at what the Schultzes were thinking of her staying
away so long, racked her with remorse and suffering,
but Von Pfaffen quieted her fears, assured her
over and over of marriage as soon as his affairs could
be arranged, as soon as the work in which he was
engaged, should be finished.
</p>

<p>
There was nowhere to go, nothing to do.  She had
no money, and so miserably, she stayed on, hoping as
each day came, that it would bring the marriage he
was promising.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes she would look at the pile of papers on
the littered table and plead with him not to wait till
they were finished.  Those piles of papers seemed
interminable.  Her training, her mentality, all her
instincts told her, that after what had happened, she
was eternally damned unless he married her, and it
was that hope which kept her spirit alive.  She lived
from day to day waiting for this salvation.  When
he made his work, as he always did, his excuse, she
would look up into his eyes and resolve to wait.
</p>

<p>
He had set her mind at rest as to what the Schultzes
would say, by telling her that they knew where she
was, that he had told them he had engaged her as
his secretary.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that a better position for you, than teaching
stupid children or singing in a smoky café?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
He had sent old Lena away to visit her people,
and given over his keys and the care of his rooms to
Marie.  In spite of the thought of whether the convent
and her father would have approved of the state
of affairs, while waiting for the marriage, her fears
were gradually lulled and little by little, she came to
take things almost as a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
She had wanted to go back to her room at the
Schultzes for her few belongings.  The only clothes
she had were her little white dress and the coat which
she had worn the night they came here from the "Two
Eagles."  But Von Pfaffen had laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind those few rags, <i>Liebchen</i>," he said,
"come with me and we'll get some more."
</p>

<p>
Marie had demurred at this, but he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"As my future wife, you owe it to me to look as
pretty as you can!  When I introduce you to my
friends, you want me to be proud of you, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly Marie had come to agree that perhaps
after all, this was right, that she could accept these
things almost as a marriage gift.  Surely it meant
that she could trust him.  She resolved, however, to
select only what was absolutely necessary.
</p>

<p>
But her eyes sparkled over the lovely clothes which
were the result of this decision, for although she had
chosen only plain things, Von Pfaffen had insisted
on adding one or two dainty dresses from which she
had resolutely turned away.
</p>

<p>
Marie was in that state of her development, where
absolute dependence upon other people was a
necessity.  She had clung to the Schultzes as she now clung
to the belief and hope that this man would, in the end,
exonerate her in the eyes of her conscience.
</p>

<p>
The chasm had been crossed, the bridge had been
burned.  She knew desperately that her only salvation
was to cling to the position in which she found
herself, she must go on in the hope that soon the
wrong that had been done her might be righted.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when he was away on this mysterious
business of his, she used to sit and brood for hours,
either staring into the fire or out of the window,
never really seeing anything.  She longed so for some
one to confide in, some one to advise her.  She thought
of the good priest at the convent, who used to smile
and pat her head after confession.  If she could only
have gone to him and asked his advice.  But Von
Pfaffen always laughed when she spoke of going to
church, and as for confession, he had absolutely
forbidden her that.  After each one of these days of
brooding, Marie would go to him when he returned
home and ask again when they were to be married.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he used to laugh as he lifted her chin
with a long forefinger.
</p>

<p>
"What a little doubter!" he would say.  "Come,
come, have patience, all in good time!" and then he
would so adroitly change the conversation that she
found herself thinking of other things in spite of
herself.  Sometimes he would be pleased to take her
seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he would say, looking deep into her eyes
with his magnetically brilliant ones, "you are the
same to me as my wife now; do you think a few words
spoken by a priest will make me feel any differently?
I'm afraid you don't love me, or you wouldn't doubt
me!"
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for it, but resignation.  If he
said things were all right, they must be.  If he said
things would adjust themselves, they surely would.
She must be content to wait.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, she came to learn that this man who
had so cavalierly linked his life with hers, and who
posed before the world as an indolent gentleman of
leisure with no other vocation than his military
duties, which, however, never seemed to take him to
the barracks, had a secret engrossing occupation.
Private matters, from the knowledge of which she
was sternly shut out, occupied his constant attention
and often took him away for long periods.  At such
times he gave her no knowledge of his destination or
when he would return.
</p>

<p>
At first she felt strange, alone in the quiet
apartment, but she grew accustomed to these journeys of
his and to the sudden sound of his key in the door,
for he would come back as quietly and with as little
intimation as he had gone.
</p>

<p>
There were callers at all sorts of queer hours, men
in uniform and men muffled in great coats with hats
pulled down over their eyes, and always when they
came, he would manage so that she would either go to
her room or would remember some little shopping she
had to do.
</p>

<p>
Once she had been awakened in the night by voices.
She opened her door softly and looked out.  Von
Pfaffen and five men were seated about the
dining-table.  They were drinking, their faces were flushed,
their manner excited.  She heard one of them ask,
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure it will come?"
</p>

<p>
To which the eldest man in the party, a burly,
square-jawed officer of high rank, replied with an
oath:
</p>

<p>
"It must come!"
</p>

<p>
She saw Von Pfaffen rise to his feet and lift his
wine glass.
</p>

<p>
"Here's to the Day!" he said.
</p>

<p>
The others rose also, and rang their glasses
together.
</p>

<p>
"To the Day!"
</p>

<p>
She closed her door quietly.  What did it mean?
What was the day for which they were waiting.
</p>

<p>
In the evenings that followed she heard this toast
again and again, and each time it stirred in her a
vague dread of some impending evil.
</p>

<p>
Once she had had a glimpse of one of these visitors
who evidently desired that his identity should not be
disclosed.  In the dim light, the face seemed strangely
familiar.
</p>

<p>
The Captain's manner as he led his guest to the
door was full of a servility she had never known him
to show to any one, but while she was still wondering,
the visitor caught sight of her and drew his coat
collar hastily up over his face.  Von Pfaffen turned
angrily and slammed the door.  She spent a long
time puzzling as to where she had seen these features
before.  It seemed to her that they had been depicted
in many photographs, but who he was she could not
remember.
</p>

<p>
When she mentioned this incident later, Von Pfaffen
told her unceremoniously to hold her tongue, though
afterward, he made up to her with extra caresses for
his rudeness.
</p>

<p>
Once she had overheard a word, a sudden phrase,
that, though she was unable to quite understand its
meaning, still filled her with breathless dread, a vague
apprehension of this engrossing work of his.
</p>

<p>
One evening when they were alone, Marie spread
a dainty little supper on the long table, pushing aside
the scattered papers with a careless hand to make
room for the tempting dishes.  There had been a
bottle of Tokay and he was flushed with the glow of
its contents, but there was a suppressed exultation
in his manner which she could not altogether attribute
to the wine he had drunk.  She had never seen him
quite like this, he was always so much master of
himself.  She felt instinctively the force of some great
underlying excitement that was gripping him.
</p>

<p>
"Little one," he bragged thickly, "some day you
and I will have everything we can wish for.  Some
day soon, we will stand by and watch all the world
rock&mdash;and when it settles down again, there will be
only one country&mdash;the Fatherland!"
</p>

<p>
She was startled at the expression that came over
his face.  It glowed with ruthless greed, the will to
dominate, to succeed, no matter what the cost.
</p>

<p>
"How strangely you talk!" she said.  "What a
wild dream!"
</p>

<p>
"Dream!  <i>Herrgott</i>!  It's no dream!  It's the
truth!" and he brought his fist down on the table so
that the empty glasses danced.  Then he suddenly
turned quiet, sullen, and after vainly trying to bring
him back to his gay mood again, Marie gathered the
remains of the little feast and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes they conversed in French when they were
together.  The Captain spoke it flawlessly, without a
trace of the German guttural, and often he would
amuse the girl by imitating Parisian street gamins
or French market women.  He was an excellent mimic
and Marie was secretly amazed at his ability to
change his personality at will.  It seemed so
incongruous with the severe dignity of his character as
she knew it.
</p>

<p>
He always spoke to her as though to a child he
was trying to amuse, but as she listened, Marie was
conscious of an indefinable apprehension, a vague fear
of this man whom she could so little understand.
</p>

<p>
During the long, monotonous days when she was
alone, she turned for solace and company to the books
which lined his room.  A new world was opened up
for her of which she had never dreamed.  She spent
long hours pouring over Schopenhauer, Kant,
Nietzsche, and even some of the Russian writers,
Tolstoi, Gorky, Dostoieffsky.  She began to see the
answers to some of her own problems through the
bitter eyes of these great Sad Ones.
</p>

<p>
One dull, cold day, when Von Pfaffen had been
away longer than usual, she curled herself up in the
great chair by the fire with a volume of Dostoieffsky's
"Letters from the Underworld."  It was one
of those wild March days, whose fierceness proclaims
it as the last gasp of winter, and the glow of the
coals was very cheering.
</p>

<p>
She turned to the story, "<i>Apropos of Falling
Sleet</i>."  The title seemed appropriate for the day,
and was in sharp contrast to the comfort of the fire.
</p>

<p>
But as she read through the bitter, stinging tirade
which is poured out on the head of a poor little
Petrograd prostitute, a tirade etched with the biting acid
of the great Russian's most caustic pen, her face
whitened, her lips trembled, the horror of it shook
her with a dreadful fear.  This first knowledge, that
because men were brutal animals there must be women
whose lot it was to suffer so, widened her eyes with
a terror like a child must feel in a nightmare.  She
threw the book away from her and tried to forget it
by looking over the scattered papers on the table.
They proved uninteresting and unintelligible to her,
and so with characteristic neatness, she arranged
them in methodical piles.  Von Pfaffen, entering in
his usual unexpected manner, observed her occupation
and was furiously angry with her, so angry that
she was frightened.  The pages of the book she had
read, still clear in her mind, she burst into hysterical
weeping.
</p>

<p>
His anger, however, was short-lived.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," he said, "it's of no matter, but
remember you are never to go near my papers again";
and Marie, grateful that the storm had blown over,
dried her eyes, promising faithfully.
</p>

<p>
She had thought many times of going to see the
Schultzes, but always there was something to prevent.
She did send them a letter enclosing a bank note, and
telling them that she was well and that soon she and
the Captain were to be married, but the letter had
come back unopened and she had concluded that for
some reason they had given up the little flat and
gone elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Once she had timidly mentioned the Russian book
to Von Pfaffen, but he had taken it from her clinging
fingers and said that such books were not for pretty
heads like hers to worry over.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally he took her to the theatre or the
opera.  She was in the midst of a world she had never
known, filled with the color and life of Vienna, the
sight of beautiful women in wonderful clothes, of
sparkle, light.  It was as though she were living in
a different sphere.  But his business engrossed him
more and more as the days went by, and to Marie,
his waning interest merely meant that these
mysterious affairs of which she knew nothing, were
taking up his entire attention.
</p>

<p>
One day Franz, the young Lieutenant, who had
been her first sponsor at the "Two Eagles," walked
in and found her busy about the place, a dainty little
apron tied over her pretty morning frock, her yellow
hair braided neatly about her small head.  This was
the first time he had seen her since those nights at
the "Two Eagles."  He stood and looked at her with
mouth and eyes open.
</p>

<p>
"Ach," he said, "so?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's answer had been filled with dignity.  There
was something about this heavy-faced boy she always
resented.
</p>

<p>
"I am the Captain's secretary," she said hastily,
and then added as she saw the flat face broaden in
an understanding grin, "the Captain and I are to
be married as soon as all this work is finished," and
she waved a small hand toward the table.
</p>

<p>
The grin on the Lieutenant's face grew into a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Married?" he chuckled.  "Married!  That's good!
I congratulate you, Fräulein," and gathering the
papers he had come for, he turned on his heel and left.
</p>

<p>
Marie could hear his noisy chuckle above the sound
of his clicking boot heels, as he hurried down the
passage.
</p>

<p>
She was furiously angry at something she had seen
in his eyes.  His coarse laugh hurt her.  All her old
doubts, which Von Pfaffen's suave manner had managed
to lull, came surging back.  This stupid young
Lieutenant, he, too, suspected what old Lena had
hinted at.  She threw herself on the couch and wept
in an agony of bitterness and shame.
</p>

<p>
When Von Pfaffen came in, she ran to him with
the tears still wet on her flushed cheeks and clung to
him desperately.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> going to marry me, aren't you?" she
sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, we'll be married," he assured her, "of
course, but we must wait.  When this pressing work
is finished, everything will be as you wish!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
And so the days flew by bringing little change,
excepting that Marie was left more and more to
herself as Von Pfaffen's work seemed to accumulate.
</p>

<p>
She seldom touched the piano when he was near,
for although she played well, she lacked the
roundness of touch, the depth of tone which pleased his
fastidious ear.  But during the long hours when he
was away, her music was a great solace to her.
</p>

<p>
Her walks never carried her far from the neighborhood,
and brought her little amusement.  It was a
peculiarly quiet, uneventful location, given over, for
the most part, to nurses and their charges.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen was away from the apartment now
for longer periods of time.  These journeys came at
more and more frequent intervals.  His manner
toward her began to change, he grew brusque and
indifferent, the slightest thing irritated him.  He
would sit for long periods at the littered table, going
over his papers in silence.  Fearful of annoying him,
she would remain quiet, crocheting endless yards of
lace or staring into the coals, and when he had finished
his work, he would gather it together, put on his hat
and coat and leave her without a word.
</p>

<p>
Once during his absence, she had ventured another
glimpse at those papers which so absorbed him, but
they seemed to be mostly tracings of curious lines,
columns of cryptic numbers and telegrams in what
appeared to be a cypher, and she soon lost all interest
as to what might be their import.
</p>

<p>
Toward spring, old Lena walked in one morning,
her pendulous nose red from the brisk winds, her
ample form swathed in the enveloping folds of an
ancient shawl.
</p>

<p>
"So you're still here, Fräulein?" was her
ungracious greeting, and Marie, who had welcomed her
with a smile, was chilled.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I'm still here, Lena," she answered, as
the old woman laid aside her wraps.  "I'm to stay
here.  The Herr Captain and I are to be married
soon."
</p>

<p>
The old woman looked at her curiously from
between her reddish eyelids.
</p>

<p>
"So," she grunted, "that's what he told you.  Well,
it's not for me to say," and she ran an inquisitive
forefinger along the ledge of the mantle in search
of dust.
</p>

<p>
Marie was angry, but it had been so long since she
had spoken with anyone besides the Captain, that
she welcomed the return of even this unpleasant
creature.
</p>

<p>
"Lena," she began, "you know the Captain so well,
you must know that he always does what he says he
will do.  Won't you be a little kind to me?  I'm a
very lonely girl."
</p>

<p>
The old woman smoothed her scanty hair, which
she wore according to an ancient fashion, banded
down on either side of her face and rolled under her
ears into a hard little knot behind.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Fräulein," she said grudgingly, "you may
be different from the 'others,' I don't know," and
that was all the conversation Marie could get from
her for the rest of the day, although she followed the
old woman about the little apartment as she grumblingly
set things back in the order in which she was
accustomed to having them, out of which Marie had
changed them.
</p>

<p>
The girl tried to talk to Von Pfaffen that night,
but it was very late when he came in and his mood
was such as to discourage any effort to continue the
conversation, and so she lay awake almost till dawn,
worrying.  She had been afraid to face this question
boldly, even to herself.  After his first promises, she
believed him because she wanted to believe him,
because her peace of mind depended upon it.  In the
books she had read before she came here, wedding
bells always ended the last chapter, journeys always
ended in lovers' meeting.  But the Captain's books
were different.  There was that horrible chapter of
Dostoieffsky, which she had since read again, and
every now and then an unpleasant picture had crossed
her mind, of one of the convent girls who had come
back weeping to the Mother Superior, and when she
allowed herself the memory, she could even now hear
the stern voice saying: "My child, you have sinned
deeply!"
</p>

<p>
But Von Pfaffen's kindness, his repeated assurances,
at first had shut out all fear of this.  Now,
however, things looked different, his manner had
changed.  Old Lena's allusion to those "others,"
disquieted her.
</p>

<p>
She thought of the letter that had come back
unopened from the Schultzes.  She recalled that the
address had been crossed out and her own substituted
in which she now remembered to resemble Von Pfaffen's
handwriting, a fact which had made no impression
on her mind at the time.
</p>

<p>
She lay watching the square of the window grow
gray with the morning light.  This couldn't come to
her, she thought; he had promised.  But supposing it
were true?  What would she do?
</p>

<p>
She fell asleep at last with the sound of his words
in her ears, "Don't you trust me?"
</p>

<p>
But it was young Franz who added the last straw
to her endurance.  He came hurrying in one morning
several days later to get a portfolio the Captain
wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Fräulein," was the young man's
greeting as old Lena let him into the living-room,
"it's nice and cozy here, I wish I could stay."
</p>

<p>
Marie pushed one of the big chairs nearer the stove.
</p>

<p>
"Why not sit down awhile," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
Usually her manner with him had repelled any
advances, but to-day she wanted to talk to some one,
anyone, even this flat-faced boy.
</p>

<p>
Franz (Marie had never learned his last name),
sank stiffly into the cushions of the great chair, his
hands with their thick fingers spread out on each
knee, the toes of his shiny boots turned toward one
another, round, pale blue eyes staring fatuously into
her face.
</p>

<p>
"You are very pretty, Fräulein," he began, but
Marie interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't compliment me, Herr Lieutenant.  I want
to talk to you if you have a few minutes to spare."
</p>

<p>
He leaned toward her with a smile that was meant
to be ingratiating.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed yes, Fräulein," he said and cleared his
throat.  "Indeed yes!  My time is at the disposal of
so beautiful a young lady."
</p>

<p>
His manner was such a ludicrous imitation of the
suave tones of his chief that Marie almost laughed in
his face, but she controlled the impulse and went
straight to the heart of her question.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, when will all this be finished?" her glance
took in not only the littered table, but the yellow
portfolio resting at the side of his chair.
</p>

<p>
"That I do not know, Fräulein.  Why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, I am waiting for that, for then the
Captain and I are to be married."
</p>

<p>
The boy threw back his head and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ach, Fräulein, you will have a long, long wait!"
</p>

<p>
"What makes you say that?"  Marie was her own
inquisitor now.
</p>

<p>
"Because," and the boy rose awkwardly, shaking
down the tight blue legs of his uniform, "because the
Herr Captain's work is never finished."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;?" Marie was on her feet now,
the scales were falling fast from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
He put a clumsy hand on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Come Fräulein, you're too pretty to worry," he
said.  "If the Herr Captain grows too busy, there's
always me."
</p>

<p>
The blood rushed into Marie's face and receded
quickly again, leaving her very lips white.
</p>

<p>
"I think you had better go," she said, and there
was that in her manner that made the Lieutenant,
after one look into her eyes, turn on his heel and leave
the room, closing the door after him with a click.
</p>

<p>
Marie stood for a long time motionless, unseeing.
They were right, Franz and Lena.  She had been a
fool, but she would give him one more chance.  She
would put the question to him unfalteringly when
he came in.  She dragged herself over to the window
seat and sat looking down into the square.  Her
hands clasped and unclasped nervously, her teeth tore
at her underlip.  She made up her mind she would
sit there and watch for him, no matter how long it
would be before he came.  With dry eyes, she stared
down into the deserted street, for even the nurse maids
and their charges were absent.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those windy spring days when the
breath of winter still lingers in the air and sends the
dust whirling in eddies about the street and around
corners.  The clouds hung low, and every now and
then, a splash of rain moistened the pavement.
</p>

<p>
Two women were coming toward each other, their
skirts blowing against their limbs and outlining them
like Greek statues.  The one as she came against the
wind, held her head low to guard her hat, her white
stockings showing above her shoe tops as her skirts
ballooned behind her.  The other leaned against the
gale and almost ran with funny little hurried steps,
as the wind pushed her before it, one hand hanging
onto her hat, the other trying to steady her flying
skirts.
</p>

<p>
They met, passed, and left the street once more to
the wind, the dust eddies and scattered pieces of
paper which danced and skittered along the
pavement.
</p>

<p>
Lena came in after awhile to find out if Marie
would have some lunch, but the girl paid no heed to
her question, and the old woman shuffled out again,
crossly.
</p>

<p>
The fire died down, the burnt coals clicking as they
fell through the grate into the graying pile of ashes.
The little clock on the mantel struck the hour, the
half hour, and again the hour, but Marie sat as she
had sat since the Lieutenant left her.
</p>

<p>
Everything Von Pfaffen had ever said came back
to her clearly, stripped of all the glamor, all the
fascination, all the hope that had held her these many
weeks.  She remembered things he had told her that
were deliberate lies, lies so cunningly worded that she
had never been able quite to accuse him of them.  She
found herself facing the fact, that almost every
statement he had made to her, though made with the
positive manner of assurance, and with every semblance
of truth, had been utterly false.  She was conscious
of a great growing anger, a fierce glow of hatred,
resentment.  Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightened.
Once for all, she would know the truth.
</p>

<p>
Several times the telephone bell shrilled out, but
she paid no heed, and then at last a huge
chocolate-colored car turned the corner and drew up at the
curb.  The chauffeur jumped down and threw open
the door.  Marie flattened her face against the
windowpane.
</p>

<p>
After a second, the Captain stepped onto the pavement
and a slender, white-gloved hand in a handsome
sable cuff, was held out.  He bowed over it, and
turning on his heel entered the apartment house.  The
chauffeur closed the door and with a purr, the car
drew away from the curb and went on its way.
</p>

<p>
Marie waited to hear Von Pfaffen's key in the lock,
her heart pounding.  No matter what his mood, she
must know her fate now.  The Lieutenant's laugh and
Lena's phrase about the "others" were ringing in
her ears.
</p>

<p>
He came in hurriedly and threw his hat and heavy
fur-lined coat on a chair.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Marie," he said brusquely, "I have only
a few seconds.  Will you ring for Lena to bring some
coffee?"
</p>

<p>
She came and stood beside him where he sat at the
table rummaging among the litter.
</p>

<p>
"I must speak with you," she said, "there is something
I must know."
</p>

<p>
"I am busy now," he did not raise his eyes from the
papers.
</p>

<p>
"When are we going to be married?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain let his thin hand rest a moment on
the edge of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Are you worrying about that again?" he asked,
looking up at her with a frown.  "Haven't I told you
as soon as my work is finished?"
</p>

<p>
"Your work will never be finished!" Marie was
echoing the Lieutenant's words in almost the
Lieutenant's stolid tone.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's face darkened.
</p>

<p>
"You're nagging again," he said.  "I have too
much to think about to be bothered about trifles.  If
you are not satisfied here, I have no doubt the
Schultzes will take you in again."
</p>

<p>
Marie drew in her breath sharply.  They were
right, and she had believed him.  She seized him
fiercely by the coat sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"You lied to me!" she cried.  "You lied!  You
never meant to marry me!  You lied to me!" and
with all her strength, she shook at his arm as a small
terrier might shake at the shaggy coat of a mastiff.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen turned and held her from him.
</p>

<p>
"I marry you?" he sneered, "a cabaret singer!"
</p>

<p>
Marie's mouth was dry, the little pulse in her
throat pounded as though it would burst.  She drew
back her hand and struck Von Pfaffen straight across
the face.
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet with an oath, his cheek a dull
red, excepting where the mark of her blow showed
livid.
</p>

<p>
"You little devil," he said between his teeth.
"What do you think you could ever be in the life of
a man like me?  You want the truth?  Well, I'll give
it to you.  You amused me, filled in long hours, when
my nerves were ready to snap.  Did you think for
a second that a woman like you could hold me?  I
thought even you had more brains than really to
believe that!  I've given you comfort, I've taken care
of you, I've given you much more than&mdash;if I must
speak plainly&mdash;you have really been worth.  There
are things of so much more moment in my life that
even this explanation is taking valuable time; but
I've this to thank you for, you have helped me tell
you what I've been meaning to, that as soon as you
care to, you are at liberty to go!"
</p>

<p>
He turned away from the flood of tears he expected
to follow his words, but the girl only stood staring
at him, terrified.
</p>

<p>
Her mind was waking slowly to another phase of
the world of which she had never dreamed.  Unconsciously,
the flower of her life was opening, developing,
and the development was agony.  She had learned
grief with the loss of her father, poverty and the
struggle for existence in that bitter year, and now
this!
</p>

<p>
She turned with a dry sob and stumbled into her
room, shutting and locking the door after her.  She
must think.  She must reason out what to do.
Shame, horrible, scourging shame, swept over her.
She threw herself in a shuddering heap across the
counterpane of her bed.
</p>

<p>
Spent with the grief and anguish that had followed
her awakening, she lay for a long while dully repeating
over and over the phrase, "he lied to me!"  Presently
this gave place to resentment, bitter hatred,
which dried her tears.  Her mind was swept of all
illusions, she saw things clearly as they were.  Once
more she faced a crisis, and swiftly she made her
decision as to what course she must follow.  She sat
up listening for the sounds that would tell of Von
Pfaffen's departure.
</p>

<p>
She heard him rattle the poker among the dead
coals, then old Lena shuffle in and set down the coffee
tray, his rough dismissal of her and the old woman's
angry grunt.  The telephone rang and she heard the
click of china, as he hastily set down his cup and
went to answer it.  She heard him say, "yes,
immediately, I'll take a cab, good-bye," and her
imagination followed him as he hung up the receiver and
shrugged himself into his great coat, and with the
sound of the closing door, she jumped to her feet.
</p>

<p>
Hastily she rummaged in her bureau drawer.
There were two or three bank notes and some gold,
besides some small change, housekeeping money.
These she stuffed into her purse, they would stand
between her and starvation for a little while at least.
She took her suit and hat from the clothes press, and
slipping off her blue gown, let it lie on the floor where
it fell.  She kicked off the little satin bedroom
slippers and pulled on her shoes.
</p>

<p>
Once in her clothes, she brought out her small
leather traveling case, and regardless of neatness or
precision, she tumbled in the necessary things.  She
hesitated over the few jewels Von Pfaffen had given
her, with the thought that they might aid her in
escaping.  She decided, however, to leave them and
placed them where they could easily be seen on her
dressing-table.  Then, carefully, she locked and
strapped the bag.
</p>

<p>
Her hat was pinned securely, she fastened the collar
of her coat, and with a last look about, she picked up
her bag and left the house.  But it was not until she
felt the cold air of the outside world whipping against
her cheeks, that she realized that she had nowhere
to go.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
There was a trolley line along the end of the
street where Von Pfaffen lived, and almost without
her own volition, Marie found herself making toward
it.  She boarded the first tram that came along,
regardless of the direction.  She paid her fare and sat
staring ahead of her.  What was to become of her?
Across the way, a fat market woman sat mumbling
her gums.  Marie found herself watching the huge,
uncorseted figure, quivering with the motion of the
car.
</p>

<p>
At each corner, the tram stopped and people kept
getting on and off, continually passing between Marie
and the old woman who dozed and woke every once
in a while, with a start.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get off where she does," thought the girl.
"I'll leave it to Fate."
</p>

<p>
After what seemed an interminable time, the old
woman pulled herself up with a jerk, gathered her
basket and various other bundles and waddled out of
the car.  Marie jumped to her feet and stumbled
after her.  She stood and watched the ungainly figure
till it disappeared round a corner, then she looked
about to see where she was.  The houses seemed
strangely familiar, and suddenly, she realized that
she was near the little flat where she had lived with
the Schultzes.  Fate was kind.
</p>

<p>
It was almost with joy that she started toward
what had been her home.  True, her letters had been
unanswered, sent back unopened, but kind Frau
Schultz and the old man would surely not turn her
away, when she told them everything.
</p>

<p>
With a beating heart, she climbed the stair.  On
the second landing, a slatternly old woman put her
head out of a door.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you looking for, Fräulein?" she asked,
in a hoarse voice.
</p>

<p>
Marie told her.
</p>

<p>
"They're not here any more," croaked the creature.
"The old man's dead, he had a stroke or something;
the old woman's gone, I don't know where."
</p>

<p>
Marie choked and staggered back against the wall.
Her only friends in all the city&mdash;one of them dead,
the other vanished.
</p>

<p>
As the door slammed, the girl started blindly down
the stairs.  An old Bible lesson came into her mind:
"<i>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
head.</i>"
</p>

<p>
She was alone, absolutely alone in this great city,
with no one to whom she could go for help.  She
walked up the street aimlessly, slowly, her lips
murmuring over and over: "What shall I do?  What shall
I do?"
</p>

<p>
On the corner she stopped.  She realized she must
collect her scattered thoughts, she must form some
plan.  It was growing late, here and there the street
lights were beginning to flicker.
</p>

<p>
Presently two men came toward her.  She watched
them as they drew near, half conscious of what she
was doing.  One was a dark, heavy-set man who wore
a plaid traveling coat and carried a shabby valise.
The other was younger, quite thin and stoop-shouldered,
his hat pulled down over his eyes.  As they
passed her, Marie heard the thin man say:
</p>

<p>
"You will arrive at the <i>Gare du Nord, mein Herr</i>.
I'm sure they will be there to meet you.  Parisians are
notably hospitable."
</p>

<p>
"We must hurry, or we'll miss the train," rumbled
the other in a deep voice and they swung into a
brisker walk as they passed Marie.
</p>

<p>
Like a flash she had the answer to her question.  In
Paris, lived the only relatives she had in the world,
some distant cousins of her mother's.  She remembered
that once her father had brought one of them
to the convent to see her.  She remembered the kindly
sparkle in his eyes, as he playfully pinched her cheek
and told her that some day when she was grown, she
must come to visit them.  They had sent her a letter
of sympathy on the occasion of her father's death.
She would go to Paris.
</p>

<p>
She had half forgotten their address, but she would
try to remember it on the train.  Turning, she
almost ran after the two men on their way to the
railroad station.
</p>

<p>
At the ticket office, she emptied her purse.  There
was very little left when she had paid her fare, but
it was with a sense of relief that Marie followed the
porter as he went toward the train with her bag.
She had taken a second-class ticket and he thrust her
into a compartment, holding out a dirty hand for his
tip.  There was scarcely time to pay him his few
<i>hellers</i>, when the train began to move, and with a
gasp she realized that she was starting out into an
absolutely unknown world, with almost nothing in
her purse between herself and starvation.
</p>

<p>
The compartment was empty.  She took off her
hat and tried to make herself as comfortable as she
could for the long journey and, as the train came to
full speed and they left the city behind, she stared
out into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
She tried to remember where this cousin she was
setting out to find, lived.  His name was Le Grand&mdash;Jules
Le Grand&mdash;the address was&mdash;the address was&mdash;and
Marie, exhausted by the bitter disappointments
of the day was sound asleep.
</p>

<p>
Toward midnight, she awoke.  Pain, humiliation,
anxiety, returned.  The dim emptiness of the swaying
railway carriage seemed to symbolize her own life.
She was so utterly helpless, so absolutely alone, being
carried on swiftly by a force over which she had no
control.
</p>

<p>
She tried to remember the Paris address as she sat
and stared at the lamp in the ceiling, swinging with
the motion of the train.
</p>

<p>
"Avenue&mdash;Avenue&mdash;&mdash;" she kept repeating, when
suddenly it came to her.  "Avenue Victor Hugo,
Number Five <i>Bis</i>!"
</p>

<p>
She almost cried aloud with joy.  Paris was no
longer a desert to her.  There was such a place as the
Avenue Victor Hugo, Number Five <i>Bis</i>&mdash;there was
such a person as Monsieur Jules Le Grand.  There
was some one in the world to whom she could go, and
Vienna, Von Pfaffen and all the months she had spent
with him, that chapter was closed, finished forever.
</p>

<p>
She dug her nails in her palms.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to bury it all," she whispered to
herself.  "I'm going to bury it deep.  None of it ever
happened.  I'm going to be born again the day I
reach Paris."
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning the train rumbled into the
station at Munich, and a fat guard snapped open the
door of her compartment, shouting:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aus steigen!  München!</i>"
</p>

<p>
She gathered her wraps and the little bag and
followed the ungainly porter to where the Paris train
was waiting at the far end of the platform.
</p>

<p>
This time the compartment was almost filled.
</p>

<p>
Two English women were already settled for the
long journey, each deeply immersed in a small red
guide-book.  In one corner, a smart little Viennese
with penciled eyebrows and reddened lips, smiled to
herself as she looked out of the window.  The other
two corners were also filled.  One, by a heavy,
over-dressed Jewess.  The other, piled with the luggage
of the two English women.  Marie had not the
temerity to ask them to remove it, so she sat silently
in the small space allotted her.
</p>

<p>
The train began to jolt and slowly pulled out of
the station, gathering speed, till finally it swung clear
of the houses of Munich and out into the country.
</p>

<p>
It was a drizzly cold day, with a leaden sky, and
the landscape, as they flew by, looked cheerless and
sodden.
</p>

<p>
From the pile of luggage, the English women
extracted a tea-basket and prepared to make tea.  One
of them offered Marie a cup.
</p>

<p>
She refused it with a shake of her head and a
murmured, "Thank you."
</p>

<p>
The little Viennese began humming to herself.  She
was munching some cakes out of a paper bag, and the
crumbs kept falling on her lap.  She brushed them
away with a none-too-clean hand.
</p>

<p>
"It's a long journey!" said the fat Jewess.
</p>

<p>
The little Viennese smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes long journeys have happy endings,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
The two English women were talking to each other
in low voices.
</p>

<p>
Marie only knew a few words of their language,
and she listened half curiously to the sharp, sibilant
sounds as the women evidently discussed the places
mentioned in their guide-books.
</p>

<p>
What a strange language English was, she
thought, every other word seeming to end with a
sharp hiss.
</p>

<p>
The fat Jewess, encouraged by the smile of the
little Viennese, began a voluble one-sided
conversation.
</p>

<p>
Marie watched the lamp above her head sway back
and forth.  As the trees and villages flew past, each
one bringing her nearer this great unknown city, she
wondered if there might be a possibility of her finding
happiness there.
</p>

<p>
She became aware that the two English women were
discussing her, their eyes taking in the details of her
costume.  It made her uncomfortable.  She wondered
if there was anything about her appearance that was
in the least indicative of what she had been through.
</p>

<p>
The long day wore on, in fitful conversation, brief,
uneasy snatches of sleep, weary watching of the flying
landscape.
</p>

<p>
As the light died, the two English women settled
themselves for the night and were soon asleep, their
mouths open in unlovely abandon.  The fat Jewess
ostentatiously turned her rings with the stones inside
her hands and sank into a noisy slumber.  Marie
leaned her head back wearily against the dusty red
velvet cushions, and closed her eyes, but the sleep she
so longed for as a blessed respite from her thoughts,
would not come.
</p>

<p>
Toward midnight, she sat up with the sudden stopping
of the train, as did the other occupants of the
compartment.  They were crossing the border and
the custom officers were going through the luggage.
</p>

<p>
"Sugar?  Chocolate?  Matches?  Cigars?" she
heard them say, as one by one the bags were sleepily
opened and gone through, sleepily locked and
strapped again, and a sticky stamp pasted on the
outside.  Then the door was slammed and locked and
they all settled down once more to slumber, but to
Marie, sleep would not come.
</p>

<p>
The train sped on and as the morning broke, the
others began to stir.  The two English women made
their toilets with the aid of a handsome leather
dressing-case.  The little Viennese sat up and reddened her
lips with a tiny lipstick, and fluffed her hair.  This
done, from somewhere in her small bag she brought
out a paper bag filled with food and began munching
it, happily smiling to herself as she stared out of
the window.  The fat Jewess awoke with a yawn.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we?" she asked in guttural German,
but as nobody answered, she busied herself turning
her rings right side out, and smoothing her carefully
dressed hair with the palms of her plump white hands.
</p>

<p>
Day had arrived.
</p>

<p>
Marie listlessly watched them preen themselves.
She gave a cursory pat to her own hair, a cursory
straightening to her collar.  She sat up very straight.
Her head twisted to see the flying landscape.  Her
cheeks were flushed with excitement, but under her
eyes lay violet shadows.  Her lips trembled like a
child's about to cry.  She was frightened again, now
that she was hearing Paris.  What was she going to
find there?  Suppose, after all, the address she
remembered was wrong?  Suppose Monsieur Le Grand
had moved?  With thoughts like this, she tortured
herself.  She blinked back the tears and bit her lips.
She must not break down now.
</p>

<p>
After what seemed centuries, the train rumbled into
the dark cavern of the <i>Gare du Nord</i>.  The English
women stuck their heads out of the window, calling:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Portier!  Portier!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The little Viennese gathered her small belongings.
As the train came to a standstill, and the guard
opened the door, she was out like a flash, and Marie
saw her running with a happy laugh into a pair of
masculine arms held out to her.
</p>

<p>
The English women loaded a thin porter with their
luggage which almost hid him from view, and sedately
followed him along the platform.
</p>

<p>
The fat Jewess slowly gathered her valises and
packages and stood blocking the doorway while she
bargained with the porter.  Coming at last to an
agreement, she stepped heavily down and waddled
after him.
</p>

<p>
Marie, in the shadow of the deserted compartment,
waited, too frightened to move.  The platform was a
babel of voices, shrieking porters, scolding guards,
trunks going this way and that, people jostling each
other as they came and went.
</p>

<p>
At last a porter thrust his head in at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle," he asked, "are you staying here
always?"
</p>

<p>
She was trembling as she stepped onto the platform,
and the man eyed her curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Taxi?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," gasped Marie, "of course."
</p>

<p>
She followed him through the maze, and handed
her ticket to the gate-keeper.  As she stood on the
steps of the great station, waiting till the man should
have found her a cab, a sense of utter desolation came
over her.  Paris, gay, wonderful, laughing Paris,
lay before her, but to the girl, it seemed as though
she were staring into Chaos itself.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
The taxi rolled along the Champs Elysées and
finally, turned into the Avenue Victor Hugo and
stopped at Number Five <i>Bis</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Behold, we have arrived, Mademoiselle," smiled
the driver genially, as he turned about and looked
down at her from his seat.
</p>

<p>
Marie rose hurriedly and stepped to the street.  As
she opened her purse to pay the man, she suddenly
realized that she had nothing but Austrian money.
</p>

<p>
"I have no French money.  Will you&mdash;can you take
<i>this?" and she held out a small handful of </i>hellers<i> and
kronen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The man looked dubiously at the unfamiliar coins,
and lifted expressive shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"But Mademoiselle, what can I do with those?"
he said.  "Go in the house and get it from your
friends."
</p>

<p>
Marie's heart sank.  Suppose the Le Grands no
longer lived here!  Suppose a thousand things!  But
realizing that the man must be paid, she decided to
do as he suggested.  She stooped to pick up her bag,
but he stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, Mademoiselle, allow me," and taking it
from her, he followed her to the door.  It was a long
way from the <i>Gare du Nord</i>.  He was not anxious to
lose sight of his fare.
</p>

<p>
A stout, red-haired man with weak eyes and a green
apron tied loosely about him, opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Does Monsieur Le Grand, Monsieur Jules Le
Grand live here?" asked Marie nervously.
</p>

<p>
It seemed an age to her before he answered.
</p>

<p>
"But yes," he said at last, "they have been living
here this long time."
</p>

<p>
"Will you take me to them, please?"  Marie
could have thrown her arms about his thick neck.
</p>

<p>
The man bowed politely, and picking up her bag,
led the way.
</p>

<p>
She turned to the waiting driver.
</p>

<p>
"I'll send down your money.  Wait, please!" she
said, and followed the red-haired man through the
doorway into the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
He handed her into the little <i>ascenseur</i>, and touching
the button, bowed as he closed the door.
</p>

<p>
On the way up, Marie repeated a prayer of gratitude
over and over to herself, adding one with the
hope that these cousins would be glad to see her.
</p>

<p>
As she got out at the door of the Le Grand
apartment, a neat little maid opened it.
</p>

<p>
"Is Monsieur Le Grand at home?" she asked timidly,
and as the girl answered in the affirmative, she
added, "tell him his cousin from Vienna&mdash;his cousin
Marie Helmar is here!"
</p>

<p>
Almost as she spoke, a tall stout man with a heavy
black beard appeared in the doorway of what seemed
to be a little salon.
</p>

<p>
He looked at Marie a moment and then came
toward her with both hands extended.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my little cousin," he cried in a cheerful bass
voice.  "My little cousin!  But I'm glad to see you.
Welcome to Paris!"  He kissed her resoundingly on
both cheeks, and drew her in through the door which
the neat little maid closed after her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cousin Jules," and Marie let the foolish tears
run down her cheeks as they would, "I was so afraid
you wouldn't remember me!  I was so afraid you
wouldn't live here any more!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Maman</i>," called Monsieur Le Grand, "come and
see who is here!"
</p>

<p>
"Please, cousin Jules," hesitated Marie, "the taxi
driver is waiting.  My money is all Austrian&mdash;could
you&mdash;&mdash;?" and she displayed her purse with its
foreign coins.
</p>

<p>
The big man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Surely, little cousin," he said, as he drew a leather
bag from his pocket, and extracted the necessary
francs.  "Here, Julie, run and pay the man," and
picking up Marie's bag he led the way into the salon.
</p>

<p>
Madame Le Grand was a pretty little woman,
round and dimpled, her hair and eyes as black as the
shining silk of her gown.  Two tall, slim girls stood
beside her, their eyes dark like their mother's, their
straight hair loose over their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"This is the little Marie, <i>Maman</i>," smiled the big
man, "this is the little blond cousin from Vienna," and
he led the girl forward.
</p>

<p>
Madame Le Grand kissed her affectionately as did
both the girls.  Monsieur Le Grand and <i>Maman</i>, who
she found was to be called Cousin Françine, asking
questions volubly.  How long had she to stay?  Why
had she not let them know?  Why had they not heard
from her since the lawyer had written of her poor
papa's death?  Did she know how much she looked
like her poor papa?  Or was it her poor mamma she
resembled?  And so on, and so on, until finally for
sheer want of breath, they stopped, and Marie began.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't decide to come until the day before
yesterday," she said in her careful French; "but now, I
am not going back.  I expect to make my home in
Paris.  I must find employment."
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Le Grand looked at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You must earn your own living?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; poor papa left me very little, and it is all
gone."
</p>

<p>
Her cousins looked at each other sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," soothed the big black-bearded man,
"to-day you will be comfortable and have a good rest.
To-morrow we will discuss your affairs."
</p>

<p>
"Fleurette, my angel," said Madame to one of the
girls, "show Cousin Marie into the little blue room.
You can arrange your toilette, my dear, and afterward
Sidonie will come and get you for luncheon."
</p>

<p>
Marie smiled gratefully.  How wonderful things
were.  Madame patted her kindly on the arm as she
turned and followed one of the two tall girls.
</p>

<p>
The blue room proved to be very pretty, dainty
and sweet as the one Marie had had in her father's
house.  The sight of it brought back the thought of
him bitterly, and tears welled into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Fleurette comforted her shyly, and after refreshing
her face and brushing out her soft hair with
Fleurette's interested assistance, she opened her bag
and shook out a fresh blouse which she proceeded to
put on.
</p>

<p>
"What should I have done if you had moved
away?" she asked, and Fleurette shrugged expressive
and sympathetic shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Presently, Sidonie, the second of the two sisters,
came in to say that luncheon was ready, and with one
of her young cousins on either arm, Marie went into
the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
It was a happier meal than she had eaten for some
time.  Truly, she was born again.  Here, no one
knew anything about her, excepting that she had
been raised in a convent and was her father's daughter.
The girl found herself wondering if she were
dreaming, if suddenly she should awaken and find
that all these cheerful, black-eyed cousins had
disappeared, and Von Pfaffen's hard, cruel face was
opposite her.
</p>

<p>
But one thing she had learned from him was that
her face must be a mask to conceal emotions, not a
window to let them shine through.
</p>

<p>
She had learned that her "convent eyes" as Von
Pfaffen used to call them, were a useful asset, and
though her faith and trust in the world had died, she
shut her resentment resolutely away and smiled.
</p>

<p>
The time passed pleasantly, and that night Marie
slept soundly for the first time in many days.  When
she opened her eyes the next morning, the sun was
streaming into her room.  She felt it to be a happy
omen, a harbinger of better things.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Monsieur Le Grand called her to him.
</p>

<p>
"We have been talking, the good <i>Maman</i> and I,"
he said in his rumbling bass voice.  "Would you like
to stay here with us, even after your visit is over,
and, well, teach Fleurette and Sidonie the German
language, a little painting, and perhaps some music?
Would you like that?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Maman</i> smiled into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Would you, little cousin?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
Marie's heart was full.  This was almost too good
a fortune to be true, but she managed to answer them
gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"You are so kind, so good, what would I have done
if I had not found you?  What I can, I will
gladly do."
</p>

<p>
This past year was one that had shaken her faith
in every one and everything, but surely these people
must be genuine.  She was afraid, however, to give
way to the feeling of comfort and trust that filled
her, her experiences had taught her suspicion of those
about her.  Sadly she realized that convention sometimes
requires people to do and say things to impress
the ear and the eye only.  She knew now, that real
personalities were guarded jealously.  One's real self
must be carefully concealed from the knowledge and
the eyes of those with whom one came in contact.  She
was afraid to trust what seemed so sincere, so kindly.
She must weigh even her seemingly generous cousins.
She must try and analyze even their motives and be
on her guard.  But she also knew she must let none
of these thoughts be seen.
</p>

<p>
She held out her hands to her cousin and his wife
and looked into their eyes with her own wide blue
ones, and so her new life, the life that was born again,
began.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
The days passed swiftly for Marie.  The kindly
hearts of the Le Grands were won almost immediately
by her sweetness and charm, her appealing air of
innocence that seemed to demand protection.  They
surrounded her with an atmosphere of love, of
generous kindness, and Marie's nervousness began to
leave her.  She and the two girls took long walks
through the blossoming <i>Bois</i>, or along the beautiful
Champs Elysées.  Fleurette and Sidonie never tired
of showing their Austrian cousin the sights of their
beloved Paris, and Marie found herself forgetting the
bitter winter in Vienna.  It was as though there had
been some horrible nightmare from which she had
awakened into the sunshine of spring.
</p>

<p>
At first, she used to start up suddenly in the night,
shuddering with the thought of what would happen
if her cousins should come to know the truth.
Sometimes, while she was giving a German lesson to
Fleurette and Sidonie, the familiar tones of her own
language recalled the days in Vienna which she was
trying to forget, and made her sink back into her
chair, white and shaken.
</p>

<p>
At such times, Fleurette would pat her hand
sympathetically and comfort her for what she supposed
was homesickness, and Sidonie would jump to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Cousin, no more lessons now, the sun is
shining, we must walk in the <i>Bois</i>."
</p>

<p>
Little by little, Marie's fears of their finding out
faded away, and her conscience ceased to trouble her.
No one who had known her in Vienna was ever likely
to come here.  Old Herr Schultz was dead, his wife
would never leave her native country.  Besides these
two, there were only Von Pfaffen and the young
Lieutenant, who knew; and they, she felt sure, would
never cross her path again.  Little by little her
confidence in people began to return, at least in these
cousins of hers and their friends.  Her knowledge of
human nature, of character, began to expand.  She
was able to put people in their proper niches, as it
were, and hide her own fear and distrust under a
cloak of shyness and reticence.
</p>

<p>
Happy in this pleasant environment, her cheeks
grew round, her color came back, and the sparkle
that was in her eyes in the convent days, shone from
them again.  Her cousin Jules, she found, was
something of a personage, and there were always people
of more or less importance coming to see him, but
Marie and the two girls seldom met any of these
visitors.  Fleurette and Sidonie were still too young,
and so she stayed with them, but on the days when
there were no guests, the little family were all very
happy together.
</p>

<p>
The Le Grands belonged to that class of French
people whose family is the heart of their life, who
live only for the development of their own immediate
circle, who are economical, yet generous and
hospitable, and Marie was beginning to realize that here
she could shut away suspicion and be happy.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Le Grand always insisted on hearing the
girls repeat their German verbs.  He would burst
into roars of laughter at their struggles with the
heavy gutturals.  Madame, on those occasions, always
sat by a little table on which a red-shaded lamp lit
up her dark prettiness and sparkled on her black silk
gown, flashing back from her rings as she knitted or
crocheted.
</p>

<p>
Marie's life was full.  She gave the girls their
lessons, took long walks with them and sometimes would
go on a bewildering shopping excursion with Cousin
Françine; and so gradually the bitterness of the past
was shut away in a corner of her memory.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, Sidonie burst into her room in
great excitement, Fleurette following at her heels.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," she cried, "we are to be at dinner
to-night!  There will be a guest, but the good papa
says we may come, because he is young, like us.  We
think he's wonderful.  We hope you'll like him too."
</p>

<p>
"I am to wear my white lace dress with the blue
sash," said Fleurette.
</p>

<p>
"And I shall wear mine, also," added Sidonie.
</p>

<p>
"But," began Marie, "I cannot come, I have
nothing to wear!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes you have," laughed Fleurette.  "I
unpacked your bag the night you came.  I saw a pretty
little white frock in it.  It was badly crushed, but
we'll take it to Julie, and she will press it out as good
as new," and skipping to the clothes press, she began
searching.
</p>

<p>
Marie remembered with a shudder, that she had
crumpled the white dress she had worn at the "Two
Eagles," into her bag.  She abhorred the thought of
wearing it.  It would bring back bitter memories,
but she could not come to dinner when there would
be a guest, dressed as she was.
</p>

<p>
The girls were examining the simple frock which
Fleurette had unearthed.
</p>

<p>
"I think it's very nice," decided Sidonie.  "I'll
take it right down to Julie and she will press it for
you."
</p>

<p>
"And you must do all this wonderful golden hair
in a pretty fluffy way," said Fleurette, "no flat
braids to-night, cousin.  We'll all play that we're
grown up.  Won't it be fun!" and she danced away
with the crushed white muslin over her arm.
</p>

<p>
Marie stood by her window thinking.  She hated
to put on the white dress, to pile her hair up under
a high comb.  It all seemed as though she were going
to the "Two Eagles" again to sing.  She wouldn't,
she couldn't do it.  She would tell the girls when they
came in, that she was ill.  She would make any excuse
so as to stay in her room.  She would destroy that
dress.  She wondered why she had ever brought it.
</p>

<p>
The window stood open to the soft June air.  She
leaned her head against the casing and let the breeze
fan her hot cheeks.
</p>

<p>
She squared her shoulders.  Why should the dress
bring back memories?  That life was dead and buried.
It had never been!  She turned from the window, and
began to let down her fair hair as Fleurette and
Sidonie came in carefully carrying the freshened
muslin.  It was beautifully pressed.  They laid it
primly across the bed.
</p>

<p>
"You will look just like one of the angels, all yellow
hair and white wings," said Fleurette, coming over
to her, and drawing her shining tresses through her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"A little Sainte Marie," said Sidonie, and then
glancing at her own reflection, she added, "I wish I
were a blonde.  Nobody ever thinks of a black Saint,"
and she made a grimace at her own image in the
mirror.
</p>

<p>
"It is late now," reminded Marie.  "Better go and
dress.  When you are ready, come back for me.  I
shall be frightened to meet a stranger alone."
</p>

<p>
The girls laughed and hurried away.
</p>

<p>
Marie closed the door after them.  Then she went
over to the bed and stood looking down on the fluffy
whiteness in which she had been so miserable.
</p>

<p>
"What a horrible time I had when I wore you
last," she said to it.  "I wonder what will happen
to-night," and half fearfully, she began arranging
the wavy masses of her hair.
</p>

<p>
When the girls came back for her later, resplendent
in their soft frocks, each with its pale blue sash tied
in exactly the same manner, they uttered little
shrieks of delight over Marie.
</p>

<p>
"But you are lovely, cousin," cried Fleurette.
"Your shoulders are like snow."  She looked very
fair and golden in contrast to their vivid coloring.
</p>

<p>
"When I am grown, I shall do my hair like that,"
said Sidonie, "only it isn't the right color."
</p>

<p>
Marie laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Your hair is just the color it should be for you.
Are you really pleased with me?"
</p>

<p>
They assured her joyously that she was perfection
itself, and indeed she was a dainty figure; rounder,
more mature than on that day not so many months
before, when she had donned the white frock to go
to the "Two Eagles."  There was a flush on her
cheeks which had not been there the last time she had
worn it.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, "let us go and see the good
parents," and giving a hand to each of the girls they
started sedately for the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"How charming you look this evening," smiled Le
Grand.  "You will like my young friend; he is an
officer in the army.  His parents live in a fine old
chateau somewhere near the frontier."
</p>

<p>
Almost as he spoke, the maid opened the door and
announced Captain de la Motte.
</p>

<p>
Fleurette and Sidonie, suddenly shy, stepped back
of their mother, while Monsieur went forward to greet
his guest.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall, slender man of about thirty, very
sunburnt, with a lighter line across his forehead,
where his cap had rested.  His eyes were wide and
brown, and his dark hair combed straight back from
his forehead, had a slight wave in it.  His mouth was
full and almost Greek in outline, and the lean, strong
lines of his face were clean shaven.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Le Grand made the presentation in the
graceful manner of the cultured Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
The visitor smiled a flashing smile that lit up his
face and showed a row of very white, even teeth.
</p>

<p>
Marie sat shyly quiet through the evening, but
her mind and eyes were alert.  There was a boyish
ingenuousness about this man that was refreshing.
It seemed to deny his knowledge of certain phases
of life, seemed to stamp him as different from the
men with whom she had come in contact.  Surely
there must be some men who could be trusted.  She
wondered if it were possible that back of those clear
eyes, might lurk deception, whether the smile that
seemed so worthy of trust, hid falseness.  But in
spite of the involuntary distrust that was the result
of her experience, her interest was aroused.  His
frank <i>camaraderie</i> with her two young cousins, the
amusing tales he told of the barracks, his keen sense
of humor that was expressed in clear, hearty laughter,
put her wonderfully at her ease, and above all
things he had unmistakably that distinctive manner
which proclaimed him a gentleman.  It was a very
pleasant evening, and when at last he rose to go,
deep in her heart was a half-formed wish that here,
at least, she might be off the guard she had so
strictly imposed upon herself.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
In her room that night, after he had left, Marie
slipped off the white frock, shook out the folds almost
tenderly and hung it carefully away.  She stood
for a moment in deep thought, then she went to the
dressing-table and picking up the hand-mirror,
began examining her delicate profile, the way her hair
grew about the nape of her white neck.  The blue
ribbons in her dainty camisole outlined her slim
shoulders and matched the blueness of her eyes.  It was
a very lovely face that looked back at her from the
mirror.  Marie had never thought of her personal
appearance as a vital asset before; now, however,
with the memory of a flashing smile, a frank boyish
face before her, she examined herself closely.  Was
she really attractive, she wondered?  She lacked the
egotism, the self-knowledge which is able to catalogue
its own charms.  The desire to be appreciated, however,
was strong in her.  Her sensitive nature was
instinctively conscious of approval or disapproval.
</p>

<p>
She rested her elbows on the dressing-table and
propped her chin in her cupped hands.  Could she
dare hope for happiness such as came into the lives
of other girls?
</p>

<p>
This was the sort of man that had filled her dreams
at the convent, tall and straight, with the supple
slimness of a man of action.  But she had only
dreamed.  In actual life she had found men very
different.  Might not his pleasing manner and boyish
friendliness be only another sort of mask, hiding
perhaps as much calculation, as much designing
selfishness, as had that other of paternal kindness?
</p>

<p>
Her experience had been too bitter.  She dared not
lower the barriers a second time.  She was in that
most unhappy state of mind which follows the loss of
faith and trust in others.
</p>

<p>
What was the matter with her, she wondered?  Was
it because the sight of a uniform had brought back
recollections, or was it something she had read in the
wide dark eyes as they looked into hers when he had
said good-night?
</p>

<p>
She undressed slowly, and shook out her long hair.
The window was open to the soft June night, and
the breeze lifted the golden strands and blew them
against her flushed cheeks.  She switched off the light
and stood for awhile looking out over the sleeping
city.  She looked almost like the Saint Genevieve of
Puvis de Chavannes, in her straight nightrobe, her
hair parted and drawn down into a long yellow braid,
her bare feet white against the polished floor.  The
flashing smile that lit up the dark face shone across
her mental vision.  Would she see this man again,
she wondered?  Did she want to?  She pulled the
curtains across the window and crept into bed.  For
a long while she lay staring up through the velvety
darkness.
</p>

<p>
She did want to see him again.  She lived over the
moment when their eyes had met, the blue ones and
the brown ones that seemed to strike fire.  Could this
face too, with its clean lines and flashing smile, grow
distorted and evil as she had seen the other?
</p>

<p>
At the thought, she buried her face fiercely in the
pillow.
</p>

<p>
"No," she whispered to herself in the darkness.
"No, I'll never see him again!  I never want to!  Men
are all alike, I hate them!" and she began to tremble
with cold under the covers on this warm June night.
</p>

<p>
After awhile, she fell into a troubled sleep and
dreamed that she was singing again at the "Two
Eagles" and that Captain de la Motte came and took
her by the hand and led her to an open window,
through which she could see a broad, beautiful
landscape.  It seemed to her that a great storm had just
passed, the last clouds disappearing in the distance,
and across the arch of the heavens stretched a
wonderful rainbow.  Birds were singing, and the air was
sweet with the perfume of flowers.  Just as she was
about to start out with him into the sunlight, Von
Pfaffen came between them and she awoke, weeping
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
But de la Motte called again and yet again, and
soon it became a matter of course that Marie and the
two girls should meet him on their walks in the <i>Bois</i>
and walk home together.
</p>

<p>
The young soldier's interest was perhaps accentuated
by her very reticence, the difficulty he found in
drawing her out, in making her believe in his friendship.
Without letting him quite see her purpose, she
set herself the task of making him prove himself in
every way, and though her suspicious eyes were
always seeking for a flaw, he withstood all her tests.
</p>

<p>
This was the beginning of many happy days.
Madame, with the love of match-making, which lies
in every Latin heart, smiled and dimpled at young
de la Motte every time he came, and managed to see
that he and Marie were thrown together as much as
possible.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, her shyness wore off and she found herself
talking of the years spent at the convent, of her
days with her father.  But she always stopped short
with his death, and de la Motte attributed the silences
that followed, to her bereavement.  He would change
the subject to some trivial matter and soon the smiles
would come back again.
</p>

<p>
He was like a big, carefree boy with the three girls,
and as the days wore on, Marie began to realize that
her happiness lay where he was.
</p>

<p>
The thought frightened her.  She tried to reason
with herself, to bring her experience to her aid.  How
could he, the sort of man who could win any girl,
the son of General de la Motte, ever think of her, the
penniless little cousin in his friend's household?
</p>

<p>
But after awhile, she hushed the voice of reason,
and let herself drift along in a dream that had as
its awakening the days between his visits.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon de la Motte called early.  He had
not been expected, and Madame Le Grand and the
two girls had gone for a shopping tour, leaving Marie
at home alone.
</p>

<p>
When the maid showed him into the salon where
she was, the girl rose hastily from beside the little
work-table where she had been stringing beads for
the purse Madame was knitting.  Her cheeks flushed
prettily as she held out her hand to him.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin Françine and the girls will be
disappointed," she said, "but they will be home shortly.
You will sit down awhile?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed as he drew a chair up beside her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Mademoiselle, I suppose it's rude
to say, but I can't feel badly that they are not here.
I'm glad I find you alone!"
</p>

<p>
There was something in his manner that startled,
almost frightened her.  The smile faded from her
lips.  She dropped her eyes over her work and sat
silent.
</p>

<p>
He watched her uneasily.  What a difficult little
person she was.  The smile that had greeted him was
so encouraging that he had almost uttered the words
that were now nearly always at his tongue's end, yet
here she was, frozen stiff again, safely ensconced
behind the bars she so seldom let down.  Her very
diffidence spurred him to discover what lay back of those
clear, wide eyes, those eyes that were so like a child's,
and yet a child that had been badly frightened at
something.
</p>

<p>
He leaned forward and covered her hand with his.
</p>

<p>
"Please put down your work, Mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
She drew her hand away and hastily rose to her
feet.  Her fears had been well grounded.  He was
like the rest.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Monsieur," she said breathlessly.  "I'm
sorry&mdash;I&mdash;I thought we were such good friends.  I'm
sorry to have it spoiled!"
</p>

<p>
He rose too, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle, what have I done to make you
think I want to spoil something for which I have been
striving?"
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes that wanted so to believe in
some one.  The look she saw in his, made her flush
with a new, ecstatic wonder.  If she could only
believe it.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to read her doubts, to understand the
fear that tore at her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he said softly, "love to me is a very
wonderful thing, so wonderful and precious that I am
old-fashioned enough to think it must only be offered
where one wishes to give one's life.  Some day,
perhaps, you will let me speak to you again of this,"
and stooping, he touched his lips for a moment to her
fingers and left the room.
</p>

<p>
Marie sat for a long while after he had gone, with
her hands idle in her lap, her eyes filled with a vision
of what might be.  Confidence, faith, where she so
longed to bestow it!  If it only could be true!  She
began to realize that here was a different love than
had been offered her before, a love that had respect
for its foundation.
</p>

<p>
When her cousins returned, they found her sitting
in the gloaming, dreaming, with so little of her work
done, that they laughed and called her "lazy one,"
and said she must come with them and see all their
purchases, and with her mind singing over the hope
of that "some day" that he had spoken of, she went

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
For some time after this, de la Motte did not come
to the Avenue Victor Hugo.  Cousin Jules reported
that he was busy with his military duties.  There was
some activity at the <i>caserne</i>.  Soldiers were drilling
for a review, but he sent his kindest greetings and
promised to be with them again as soon as it might
be possible.  But he was never absent from Marie's
thoughts, and she dreamed the glad dreams that
youth knows when love has come.
</p>

<p>
When he came again, it was to ask Marie to meet
his family.  They were in Paris for a few weeks, while
his sister, who was to be married shortly, bought some
of her <i>trousseau</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I want them to meet you," he said.  "I want you
to know my sister Paulette; I know you will be
friends."
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted her eyes to his.  Could she dare to
hope that what she saw there was true?  She was
almost afraid to dream it, afraid to let him tell her
so.  He was so different from any she had known,
with his flashing smile, his clear eyes that looked so
steadily into hers.  She wanted, above all things, to
believe in him.
</p>

<p>
So it was arranged that Monsieur and Madame Le
Grand were to take her to call on his family.
</p>

<p>
The girls helped her with her simple toilet.  Her
hat must be set just at the right angle, her gloves,
her shoes, must all be perfect.  They were as excited
as she was over the prospective visit.  Madame also
was dreaming dreams.
</p>

<p>
"You will like the General," she said.  "He is a
very gallant old soldier.  He will not frighten you,
cousin; and Madame and Paulette are charming."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody will love you, little Sainte Marie,"
said Fleurette, "everybody must"; and Sidonie added,
"But, of course, how can it be otherwise?"
</p>

<p>
The de la Motte family were staying at a hotel on
the Place Vendôme, one of those hotels whose
unpretentious exterior gives no indication of the refined
comfort to be had within.  It was the hotel at which
the family always lived when in Paris, and its
proximity to the Rue de la Paix made it particularly
convenient now for the purchasing of Paulette's
<i>trousseau</i>.
</p>

<p>
She was to be married to a young Belgian officer,
Gerome had explained, Maurice le Cerf.  They had
grown up together, and both families had been looking
forward to this event for years.  Maurice's home
was not far from the Château de la Motte, which
was situated close to the border, and the young lovers,
were seldom separated.  Their marriage was to take
place some time in August.
</p>

<p>
Gerome opened the door of his father's suite for
them.
</p>

<p>
Back of him smiled the General, who held out a
cordial hand to Marie as they entered.  He was a
tall, well built man of about sixty, his gray hair was
brushed back from his forehead, a heavy grayish
mustache hid his mouth, and over his keen blue eyes
hung thick, grizzled eyebrows, one of which was lifted
a trifle, giving him a kindly, quizzical expression.
There was a strong resemblance between father and
son, but the elder's features were more massive.  He
was taller, heavier, more powerfully built.
</p>

<p>
As the visitors came into the room, a lady rose
from a chair by the window.  She was tall and
beautifully poised, and the simple lines of her dark dress
set off her figure.  Her hair was almost white and
rolled back from her face in a smartly dressed
coiffure.  Her wide, dark eyes were so like Gerome's that
Marie did not need his words to confirm the fact that
she was his mother.
</p>

<p>
She greeted her with cordial grace, her sweet
informality, immediately putting the girl at her ease.
</p>

<p>
There was some little conversation between Madame
Le Grand and the hostess, concerning various mutual
acquaintances and things that interested them, and
then Gerome's mother turned again to Marie.
</p>

<p>
They talked awhile of many things, of the charm
of Vienna, of how she liked Paris; and when they
found she knew no more of France, they promised her
that she should see all of their beautiful country.
Monsieur Le Grand told some anecdotes of her father,
and his wife smiled fondly at Marie as she spoke of
the days with them since she had come to Paris.
</p>

<p>
Presently a very pretty girl came in from another
room.  She was, perhaps a year younger than Marie,
slender, with dark hair which waved softly back
from a smooth, white forehead.  From under her
straight black brows her eyes looked out with just a
hint of superciliousness.  If there could be any
criticism of the lovely face, it was perhaps, that the
features were too regular, for beauty is accentuated by
some slight defect that enhances it by comparison.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed for the street in a smart, dark
brown walking suit and a wide-brimmed sailor hat.
Her slender feet and trim ankles were cased in bronze
shoes and silk stockings.
</p>

<p>
Gerome rose to greet her.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," he said, "this is Mademoiselle Helmar."
</p>

<p>
Paulette smiled her brother's flashing smile.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome has told us much about you," she said.
"We have been looking forward to your visit," and
after shaking hands with the Le Grands, she crossed
the room and sat on the arm of her mother's chair.
Her words had been gracious, her manner all that it
should be, but there was a subtle something that took
Marie's ease from her and brought back her nervousness.
The almost too classic face held a vague suspicion
of her, a vague challenge.  It was as though she
were saying, "Who are you?  What is it in you that
has captured my brother?  I resent it.  I'm not sure
whether you are good enough for him.  I am not sure
anyone is!"
</p>

<p>
The family were to be in Paris another week, it
seemed, and the General made plans for them to go
to the theatre together, "so that we may grow to
know one another," he explained.
</p>

<p>
Marie blushed as she thanked him, and it was
decided that early in the week she should dine with
them and they would go to the Opéra Comique, or
perhaps the Théâtre Française afterward.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Le Grand, in his deep bass voice,
rumbled out plans for them to come to the Avenue Victor
Hugo; Madame smiled and dimpled as she seconded
his invitation, and presently they rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"We will see you very soon, I hope," she smiled, as
she made her adieux, and turning to Paulette, she
wished her again much happiness.
</p>

<p>
Marie smiled timidly as she bade Madame de la
Motte good-bye.
</p>

<p>
"It has made me happy to meet you," she said.
</p>

<p>
Madame kissed her cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome's friends are ours," she said kindly.
</p>

<p>
The Le Grands pleaded another engagement, so
Gerome was to see Marie home.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful June day and the Paris streets
through which they drove sparkled in the sunshine.
The motor was well on its way along the Champs
Elysées before either of them spoke.
</p>

<p>
Marie was nervously silent, and he, too, sat staring
straight ahead of him.  Every now and then she stole
a glance at the brown profile beside her.  She was
conscious of an almost irresistible longing to put out
her hand and touch him.  She grasped her parasol
handle tightly and dropped her eyes.
</p>

<p>
At last Gerome turned to her.
</p>

<p>
"You like my family?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Your mother is wonderful," she said.  "You have
her eyes."
</p>

<p>
"I resemble the General more, they tell me.  He is
fond of saying how much I am like he was at my
age."
</p>

<p>
"You are like him," she answered, as though
reviewing his qualities.  "He is very splendid!"
</p>

<p>
"And Paulette?" asked Gerome.
</p>

<p>
Marie's eyes dropped.
</p>

<p>
"She is very pretty," she said non-committally.
She was still feeling the girl's appraising eyes, the
subtle something that had put a wall between them.
</p>

<p>
Gerome laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid you wouldn't understand her," he
said.  "She is very badly spoiled, and just now nothing
or no one exists outside of Maurice and her <i>trousseau</i>.
You will love Paulette when you know her
better."
</p>

<p>
"I am certain I will," she hastened to assure him.
</p>

<p>
Gerome looked at her steadily.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you like them, Marie," he said seriously,
his voice shaking a little.  "It means much to me."
</p>

<p>
He was silent the rest of the way, and the girl's
heart beat happily.  He cared for her.  There was
no doubting the look in his eyes.  Love, real love, the
kind she had dreamed of, had prayed for, was coming
into her life.  For a moment she grew cold with the
fear that something might come to take it away.
She remembered the dream she had had the night she
had first met him, and the thought that perhaps some
shadow of her life in Vienna might come between
them, sent the blood from her cheeks and lips and left
her still and white.
</p>

<p>
The torturing thought came to her again as it had
so many times since she began to realize the seriousness
of his intentions.  Could she in honor accept
this happiness if it were offered?  Had she the right
to accept it from any man?
</p>

<p>
When they reached the Avenue Victor Hugo, her
cousins had not yet arrived and the two girls were
out with Julie for their walk.
</p>

<p>
They sat in the little salon, talking for a moment
or so, and then Gerome rose.
</p>

<p>
"I must go on now," he said.  "I shall see you
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Marie nodded, not trusting herself to speak.  She
knew her voice would shake and tremble as she was
trembling.
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand.  Gerome took it, and held
it tight.  For a moment they looked into each other's
eyes, and then suddenly, he drew her to him, crushing
her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he whispered, "I love you!  I want you!
Say yes to me!  Say yes!" and in the dizzy ecstacy
that his nearness brought her, her resolutions, her
fears melted away.  Her heart throbbing wildly, she
could only cling close to him, murmuring, "Yes."
</p>

<p>
Then followed long silences, broken by murmured
vows, happy anticipation, hopes, plans, promises.
The old, old story ever new.
</p>

<p>
When he was gone she shut herself in her room.
She was glad the family were out.  She didn't want
to see anyone just now.  She didn't want to have to
answer their eager questions as to how she liked
Gerome's people, and how they had liked her.  She
didn't want to discuss things with her cousins yet.
Her happiness was too great, too wonderful.  It
seemed a sacred thing.
</p>

<p>
Now she knew that though there was grief, sorrow,
pain in the world, cruelty and villainy, still, there was
real love, love and the sacrifices love will make.  It
came over her with a great surge of joy, that after
all, everything she had always dreamed of, hoped for,
was in the world, just as bitter experience had taught
her that other things existed as well.
</p>

<p>
There was love and all that is part of perfect,
reciprocated affection.  With a great wonder, she
asked herself, did Fate really mean to be kind?  Had
she escaped the consequences of her inexperience?
</p>

<p>
She looked at her face in the mirror.  Was this
the same girl, she wondered, who had come to Paris
so short a while ago, eyes red from weeping, and a
heart bitterly sore with the world?  The face that
shone back from the mirror, was radiant with the
mysterious glow that comes to a woman when she
loves and is loved.  She looked at the deep blue of
her eyes, sparkling with happiness.  She looked at
her parted red lips, that could still feel his kisses,
and then, suddenly, the light went out of her eyes,
the smile died, and she threw herself face down on
her bed.  What would he do if he knew, she wondered.
She couldn't lose him, she couldn't give him
up.  Her imagination showed her the lovelight killed
in his eyes and a look of loathing taking its place.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't bear it," she sobbed dryly.  "I won't
bear it!"  She could still feel his heart beating against
her breast, his breath warm on her check.
</p>

<p>
"Dear God in heaven," she prayed, "don't take him
from me!  I love him!  I love him!  Keep him from
ever knowing!  Dear God in Heaven!"
</p>

<p>
She jumped to her feet and brushed her hair out
of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"He'll never know!" she said between her teeth.
"He can't ever find out!  I won't give him up!  I
won't!"
</p>

<p>
That life was a chapter to be closed forever.  She
had been swept into it not against her will, but
because she had had no will in the matter, no power of
choice or discrimination.
</p>

<p>
Those months at the café, and with Von Pfaffen,
shuddered across her memory like some horrible
nightmare.
</p>

<p>
She would sponge them from her very mind, erase
them from her imagination.
</p>

<p>
Squaring her shoulders, and holding her chin high,
Marie looked at her image again in the mirror, and
as she saw the color coming back to her cheeks, the
light in her eyes, she knew that she had chosen the
path that she was to follow, and that whatever came,
she would fight to hold this love that had come into
her life, to put herself in tune with him, to make
herself worthy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
The General called with Gerome the next day and
the two were closeted for some time with Monsieur
Le Grand.
</p>

<p>
Marie had seen them arrive from her window.  Nervously,
she walked up and down her room, waiting to
be sent for.
</p>

<p>
When at last Fleurette and Sidonie came in for
her, their faces were glowing with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"They want you at once in papa's study," cried
Fleurette.
</p>

<p>
"But you shan't go until you tell us why,"
announced Sidonie.  Marie was flushed and eager.
</p>

<p>
"Let me by, you bad children," she laughed, trying
to push them aside.  "How should I know why
they want me?"
</p>

<p>
Fleurette threw her arms about her neck.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be angry, dear," she said.  "We were only
teasing, of course we'll let you go," and the way
clear, she went into the little salon.
</p>

<p>
Gerome came forward to greet her as she stood
shyly at the door, and the light in his eyes was such
a happy one that Marie felt as though she were lifted
into Heaven.
</p>

<p>
"My little wife that is to be," he whispered, and
led her into the room.
</p>

<p>
Madame was busy arranging on a small table the
tray of wine and cakes which the maid had just
brought in.  Monsieur Le Grand took both her hands
in his.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he laughed in his big rumbling voice,
"what is this I hear about your leaving us?"
</p>

<p>
The General kissed her on both cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"She is a rather nice little daughter for an old
man to have, isn't she now?" and he smiled
quizzically.
</p>

<p>
Marie's cup of happiness was too full.  Was she
the little orphan, who only a few months ago had
stood irresolutely on the corner of a street in Vienna,
wondering where she was going, what was to become
of her?  To have all this love, this joy, showered on
her, was too wonderful, too much.  She hid her face
on Gerome's convenient shoulder.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that Monsieur Le Grand's talk with the
General had been more than satisfactory and all that
now remained, was to arrange for the marriage to
take place as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Gerome insisted on an early date.  His suggestion
was that now since the family were all in Paris, why
not have the wedding immediately.
</p>

<p>
Marie felt curiously like a detached witness of all
this, not at all as though she were one of the
principals.  It seemed so like a dream, that she let them
discuss arrangements, and sat happily silent, her
hand held tightly in Gerome's.
</p>

<p>
It was finally decided that as the de la Motte family
were to go back to the country the third week in
June, Gerome and Marie should be married a few
days before they left.  That would give Cousin Françine
at least ten days to get the little bride ready.
</p>

<p>
While her new relatives and her cousins were drinking
each other's health and wishing each other many
felicitations and a better acquaintance; while the
General was toasting Cousin Françine's pretty face
and the two tall girls; while Monsieur was beaming
on everybody collectively, Gerome drew Marie into
the window seat.
</p>

<p>
"Are you happy, dear?" he asked as they settled
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Marie could not answer, her heart was too full.
She looked up into his glowing face and smiled.
</p>

<p>
Gerome, unlike most Frenchmen of his class, had
taken the world seriously.  He had always looked
forward to the day when he should meet the One
Woman.  His life had been well-ordered and clean,
so that when he came to her, he should be able to lay
the pages of that life before her and say, "Dearest,
I have lived for you and for the day of our meeting."  His
fellow officers had twitted and laughed at him
for a purist.  They said that he had been born into
the wrong world, no woman was worth it.  But
Gerome had gone his way, taking their chaffing.  He
had smiled into the eyes of many pretty women,
flirted lightly with others, but never let his life be
touched.  "I'm really a henpecked bachelor," he used
to tell his companions, laughing.  "I haven't yet
met the girl whom I am going to marry, but she keeps
me from a lot of mischief into which I might
otherwise fall."
</p>

<p>
When he had met Marie, her blond loveliness, her
simplicity and shyness, had won him at once, and he
had told himself that first day, that here was the
woman for whom he had been waiting, for whom he
had kept himself clean and fine.
</p>

<p>
When he had spoken to his family of her, the General,
with his characteristic clear-sightedness, had
realized that Romance had found his son, and that
whatever he or Madame might say against one of
whom they knew almost nothing, would only serve to
bring unhappiness to them all.  They were a singularly
united family and the thought of disagreement
coming among them, was impossible to realize.
</p>

<p>
The General and his wife had discussed the matter
quietly by themselves and had come to the conclusion
not to give an opinion for or against, till they had
seen this girl who had so suddenly come into Gerome's
life.
</p>

<p>
Paulette, however, had demurred.  Her brother
was so much to her, she hated to think of giving him
up to another woman, dreaded a stranger being
brought into their midst.  Her fiancé had been
raised with them all.  She could never remember a
time when Maurice had not been near.  But this was
different, and a girl from a strange country, too,
Paulette demurred.
</p>

<p>
The General and Madame de la Motte had asked
Gerome to bring Marie to see them, and her sweetness
and simplicity had won their hearts.  Besides,
the General knew and respected Monsieur Le Grand,
and he stood sponsor for the little stranger.
</p>

<p>
"She is the daughter of a great scholar," he had
told the General, "the husband of a cousin of mine.
The girl has been raised in a convent.  She is an
orphan.  Her father lost his fortune, and she tried
to support herself giving piano lessons and teaching
French in Vienna.  She could not succeed, so she
came to us.  That is her life," and he added that
Madame was planning to give the girl her <i>trousseau</i>
as a wedding gift.
</p>

<p>
Things had shaped themselves beautifully, but as
Gerome sat with Marie's small hand in his on the window
seat, while his father and her cousins toasted one
another, he knew that even if things had developed
differently, he had come to his journey's end.  He
had found the One Woman.
</p>

<p>
When they had left, and the family had excitedly
talked over everything, and Marie had been
affectionately kissed, she had begged them to excuse her,
and had hurried away to dream of her happiness in
the quiet of her room.  Her cousins' promises of the
gifts they were to give her had stirred her deeply.
</p>

<p>
These good people, how wonderful they were to
her, and she&mdash;she was going to Gerome empty
handed.  She drew out from under the neat pile of
clothing in the dresser drawer, the purse she had
brought from Vienna.  She shook out the few <i>hellers</i>
and <i>kronen</i> and the two thin bank notes which she
had never touched since her arrival.  That was all
the dowry she could bring her husband.  She stared
down at the little heap of Austrian money lying on
the white cover of her bureau.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, she seemed to see Von Pfaffen's nervous
fingers stirring among the bank notes, and the
realization of what that money meant, rushed over her in
a wave of shame.  She picked up the thin pieces of
paper and tore them frantically into shreds.  Then
she gathered the bits of other money together with
the scraps and threw them all as far as she could out
of her window.  The coins tinkled along the sidewalk,
wheeling in half circles on their edges before they
settled in the gutter.  There was scarcely any breeze
stirring, and the thin scraps of paper zig-zagged
slowly in the air.  She watched them scatter along
the pavement, her hands held out, her fingers spread
apart.  She had thrown from her the last of her life
in Vienna.
</p>

<p>
The days that followed were spent in a whirl.
There were clothes to buy, there was the little
apartment to see in the Avenue d'Antin, which Gerome had
selected, there was so much to do, that it left Marie
dizzy.
</p>

<p>
Madame Le Grand was in her element.  She hurried
the girl from one shop to another, planned and
fussed and rushed about from morning till night, the
two girls at her heels, eager and flushed, and filled
with vague dreams of the time when all this excitement
should be for them.
</p>

<p>
The day before the wedding, she came to Marie as
she was dressing for the dinner her cousins were
giving for the two families, and sat down for a few
minutes to chat.
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful that this has come to you, Marie,"
she said.  "You know we are sending the two girls to
the convent next fall, and your Cousin Jules and I
had thought of a winter on the Riviera.  We haven't
had a vacation together for so long.  There would
be nothing for you to do then, would there?"
</p>

<p>
Marie was arranging her hair as she answered.
</p>

<p>
"You have been very good to me, Cousin Françine,
I can never thank you enough."
</p>

<p>
Madame made a little denying gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak of that, dear child," she said rising.
"Now I must go, my guests will soon be here.  You
will go to confession to-night, of course."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked up at her startled.  Since her arrival
here in Paris, she had gone regularly with the family
to mass, but as yet she had not been to confession.
She had kept away, promising herself and the <i>Curé</i>,
Père Gaspard, who was the family friend and advisor,
that soon she would go to him.  Once, when the <i>Curé</i>
had reminded her of her duty, she had turned so
white, that he had patted her hand reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, Mademoiselle," he had told her,
"you can wait till you know me better.  I'm sure the
sins on your soul are not such that we need worry
over them."
</p>

<p>
When Madame had left the room, Marie sat staring
into her mirror.  She saw nothing of the confusion
of the simple bridal finery about her, nothing of
her own image reflected in the glass.  Her only
thought was that now she must go to confession.
What should she say?
</p>

<p>
When she went at last into the salon, the family
and their guests were all assembled, Madame de la
Motte, looking very regal in her shimmering gray
satin with a string of handsome pearls about her
throat, kissed her cordially as the girl came to her
side.
</p>

<p>
In Paulette's bright eyes was still the vague
suspicion that Marie had read there that first day, but
she held out her hand and flashed her brilliant smile.
</p>

<p>
Marie, of course, knew no one in Paris and it had
been decided to have the marriage as simple as possible,
so there were only the two families, Père Gaspard
and Maurice le Cerf, Paulette's fiancé, who had come
to see the <i>corbeille de mariage</i> and to the dinner
which the Le Grands were giving the little cousin as
a farewell.
</p>

<p>
Madame Le Grand smiled and dimpled at her
guests, radiant in a new shining silk, and the two
girls, their slim legs in black silk stockings, their
white frocks encircled with huge blue sashes, stood
stiffly behind their mother, looking at Marie with a
new interest.
</p>

<p>
Maurice le Cerf, never far from the side of his
pretty fiancée, welcomed Marie into their midst with
a boyish cordiality that won her heart immediately.
He was a slender, brown-skinned young officer, his
long, delicate features giving him something of a
Spanish cast.  A small mustache shaded a rather
full red mouth, and the light gray eyes shone out
curiously from his dark face.
</p>

<p>
Marie was happy, deliriously happy.  Her terror
of confession was forgotten.  She was content to sit
with her hand in Gerome's, her eyes on his.  Just to
know that he was near, was comfort, to realize that
he was hers, left her dizzy and breathless.
</p>

<p>
Both families had been generous with the gifts
they had given the young people, and the wonders of
the <i>corbeille de mariage</i> having been duly investigated
and exclaimed over, they all sat down to dine
in a happy, joyful frame of mind.  Even Fleurette
and Sidonie forgot their shyness and began to giggle
over whispered remarks, and to nudge each other
surreptitiously.
</p>

<p>
The General, his quizzical eyebrow more quizzically
raised than ever, at his place next his jovial
host, was full of entertaining anecdotes about
Morocco, Tunis and the savages along the Congo, where
he had served as a young man.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Le Grand laughed his rumbling bass
chuckle in appreciation, and capped the Congo stories
with bits of curious doings in the city offices.
</p>

<p>
Cousin Françine smiled and dimpled and gave
whispered orders to the two hired waiters who were
assisting Julie, the maid.
</p>

<p>
Madame de la Motte patted Marie's hand as she
now and then added a laughing word to the General's
reminiscences.
</p>

<p>
Paulette and Maurice whispered together at their
side of the table.
</p>

<p>
Marie let her eyes wander away from the beloved
brown ones at her side.  She was conscious of a feeling
of well-being, a sense of protection, until her eyes
came to rest on the black coat of the <i>Curé</i>.  It came
over her again in a terrifying flash, that Père
Gaspard was the symbol of what might stand between
her and all this happiness.  She lost her sense of what
was going on about the table, as she stared at the
old man's wrinkled face with its high nose and thin,
white hair.  It was a kindly, sympathetic face, but
to Marie, the deep lines about the mouth, looked
sinister, the furrows between the eyes, stern and
unrelenting.  She drew her breath sharply and tightened
her fingers on Gerome's hand.
</p>

<p>
She couldn't go to confession, she couldn't tell
about Vienna, about the café and Von Pfaffen and
all the rest, she couldn't.  Then she remembered, how
during that long journey, she had murmured over
and over, "When I reach Paris, I shall be born again,
I shall be born again!  Nothing of this has really
ever happened!"
</p>

<p>
Père Gaspard smiled at her across the table.  With
an effort she turned her eyes away.
</p>

<p>
"I have been born again," she told herself desperately.
"I have no sins to confess!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The next morning early, she was awakened by
Fleurette's kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Lazy little Sainte Marie," she laughed.  "This
is your wedding day.  Sidonie and I are going to
communion with you now, so hurry."
</p>

<p>
Marie sprang out of bed and threw open her
curtains.
</p>

<p>
"What a wonderful wedding day," she laughed
joyously, "the whole world is happy with me."
</p>

<p>
When she was ready in her simple blue walking
suit and hat, the two girls, both dressed exactly alike,
clung one to each arm, as they started light-heartedly
toward the church.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, just think, by noon to-day you will be
Madame," said Sidonie wonderingly, "aren't you
frightened?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I shouldn't be, only I should be wild
with excitement," said Fleurette.
</p>

<p>
"Marie isn't even that, are you?" and Sidonie
gently pinched her arm to get her attention, for the
girl's thoughts had been far away from these two
little inquisitive chatterboxes, tripping by her side,
through the lovely June sunshine along the Champs
Elysées.
</p>

<p>
"Not even excited," she whispered, coming back to
her surroundings, "only very, very happy!"
</p>

<p>
Communion over and the tears brushed away that
the words of the kindly old priest had brought to
her eyes, they hurried back to the Avenue Victor
Hugo to make ready for the wedding.
</p>

<p>
Marie was lovely in the white frock that Madame
had taken such pains in selecting for her.  Her golden
hair shone round her face like a saint's halo, and the
filmy masses of the white veil, floated mistily about
her.  Gerome had given her a small bar of diamonds
which she wore among the laces at her throat, and
her eyes, deep blue, unclouded and happy, shone like
stars.  Marie was lovely.
</p>

<p>
As they drove to the <i>Mairie</i> in the flower-decorated
carriage, Gerome leaned toward her, the pride of
possession lighting up his radiant face.
</p>

<p>
"I know why they call you little Sainte Marie,"
he said softly; "you look as though you had just
stepped down from heaven."  He lifted her fingers to
his lips, "and you are mine, all mine!"
</p>

<p>
The ceremony at the Mairie was short and quickly
over and they went directly to the Madelaine.  As
she followed the huge Swiss in his scarlet coat and
great black hat, down the dim aisle, her heart seemed
to stop beating.  She was unconscious of everything,
excepting the gleam of light on the tip of his staff,
and the soft crunching of his great black patent
leather boots as he plodded on ahead of them.
Everything was a confusion of dim shadows, of tall
candles flickering and flashing, of masses of flowers
and swaying wreathes of incense.
</p>

<p>
Almost in a dream, she knelt at Gerome's side,
exaltedly she made her responses and kissed the Host.
The low, deep tones of the organ thrilled through the
dim aisles, mounted in an ecstatic burst of melody,
up, up into the very heights of the great church.
</p>

<p>
The huge Swiss swung his staff and started
majestically back toward the vestry room.  Gerome took
her hand, and still in a dream, she followed.  It
wasn't until they were once more out in the sunlight
standing on the broad steps of the Madelaine, as
they waited for their white cockaded coachman to
answer the signal of the dignified Swiss, that Marie
woke suddenly to a realization of what had taken
place.
</p>

<p>
The June sunshine touched her lovingly with its
golden rays, and sent little blue and crimson lights
dancing in the diamonds of the pin at her throat as
it trembled with the throbbing of her heart.  She
looked up at the tall figure at her side in its resplendent
uniform, the quiet strength of the handsome profile,
the confident lift of the broad shoulders.  Her
heart was full of a great thanksgiving, an adoring
love beyond words.
</p>

<p>
Gerome, her husband!

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
The short honeymoon was spent at Interlaken,
which Gerome had chosen because of the quiet as well
as the beauty.  He wanted Marie to himself.
</p>

<p>
As he threw the long windows wide, the morning
after their arrival, he uttered an involuntary
exclamation at the scene of beauty spread before him.
They had arrived late the night before and the full
wonder of an Alpine sunrise shone out before their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Marie came to his side.
</p>

<p>
"How marvelous!" she whispered, her eyes wide
with the splendor of the scene.
</p>

<p>
He put his arm about her shoulders, and together
they stepped out onto the tiny balcony outside the
window.  Below them, the busy little Aa purled and
gurgled on its way to the lake.  Some sleek, spotted
cows ambled lazily across the bridge, their bells
tinkling musically through the still morning air.  A small,
red-cheeked boy prodded them idly with a long,
crooked stick.
</p>

<p>
Above them, the mighty peaks flung themselves high
into the clear blue sky, like huge giants supplicating
the morning sun.  Here and there along their sides
the mists filled tiny valleys, here and there lay deep
impenetrable shadows, but the snow on their summits
glittered and sparkled with the pink of the Alpine
glow.
</p>

<p>
To Marie, as she stood with her husband's arm
about her, came a swift, half conscious premonition
that her own life would be something like this vast
panorama spread before her; that she, too, would be
called upon to climb through the mist-filled valleys,
to fight her way through dark, impenetrable shadows,
up, up into the glow of the shining heights.
</p>

<p>
They had their breakfast out on the tiny balcony,
a delicious meal of crisp, crescent rolls and little
hollow swirls of sweet butter, clear golden honey and
steaming, fragrant coffee.
</p>

<p>
The buxom maid who served it, wore a black velvet
bodice with silver buttons, and the crisp white folds
of her ample apron matched the snow on the summit
of the <i>Jungfrau</i>.  Her cheeks were so red that the
blood seemed bursting from them, and her bright eyes
sparkled back the happiness in the eyes of the pair
she was serving.
</p>

<p>
Marie had tied her hair back, schoolgirl fashion,
with a huge bow, and after the red-cheeked maid had
left them, she came and sat on the arm of Gerome's
chair.
</p>

<p>
"What would I have done if you had never found
me," she said musingly, as she smoothed his thick
hair.  "Out of the darkness, we met!  You led me
into a world of light and love.  How wonderful it
is!"  Her eyes were large and mysterious as they gazed
over the far spaces of the valley.
</p>

<p>
"But we did meet, little Sainte Marie, and we're
never going to part, are we?"
</p>

<p>
She tightened her arm about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing or no one shall ever take you from me,"
she said, and she spoke so earnestly that Gerome
turned in his chair and held her off at arm's length.
</p>

<p>
"How serious you are," he smiled, "as if that could
be possible."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing must separate us, I'd&mdash;I'd die without
you," she said, and jumping to her feet, she
ran into the room.
</p>

<p>
Marie found amusement and interest in everything
and everybody about her.  She and Gerome were like
two children out on a holiday, and played wonderful
games of imagining the life stories of their fellow
guests at the quiet little hotel.
</p>

<p>
Their first meal at the long <i>table d'hôte</i> was one
of absorbing interest to her.  The maids who served
were each an exact counterpart of the red-cheeked
girl who had brought them their breakfast, black
velvet bodice, silver buttons, white apron and all.
</p>

<p>
Across from them, sat a very dignified German
family.  The Baron Von Dieskow, a tall, good-looking
old man who looked at Marie with a pair of very
sparkling eyes set in a handsome, merry face, burnt
quite red, had an explosive way of saying "NO!" to
everything one said, as though it was the most
wonderful thing in the world.  The Baroness&mdash;he was her
third husband, she told Marie&mdash;was a pretty little
English woman.  She brought forward a young lady
daughter, very homely and dowdyish and distinctly
German, although she spoke English to Gerome, who
liked to air his knowledge of that language, with a
pronounced Piccadilly accent.  There were also two
young children who curtsied and kissed Marie's
hand when their mother presented them.
</p>

<p>
The Baron, it seemed, had met Gerome's father
once in Paris, and there were many polite inquiries as
to the General's health, and soon he and Gerome were
deep in the discussion of mountain climbing and
hunting.
</p>

<p>
"I am not a very good shot," Marie heard the
Baron say with his merry little eyes sparkling, "in
fact, I'm not at all fatal to the birds.  Once,
however, I frightened one, but that's all," and he and
Gerome laughed heartily.
</p>

<p>
Next Marie, sat a faded little maiden lady from
Yorkshire with a Mona-Lisa smile.  She spoke French
very slowly and very badly, and hyphenated all her
speeches with a nervous little cough.
</p>

<p>
There was also a sandy-haired, pale-eyed man who
made Marie think of nothing so much as a tom-cat
with his back up.  He was a major something-or-other,
of what nationality she could not judge.  He
smiled at her in a horrid, over-polite way, and
confided to her across the table that he had been a monk
for fourteen years in the great Certosa at Florence.
</p>

<p>
"I thought they never let anyone out, who once
entered there," ventured Marie timidly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure, Madame, they would never let you out,"
he said, evidently meaning to be witty, but Marie
colored and turned away to watch the other people
about the long table.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's discussion with the Baron was still going
on briskly, and she had ample leisure to study the
curious combinations of people who drift together,
"doing Europe."
</p>

<p>
At the end of the table sat a group of Americans,
whose joyous good humor and interest in everything
attracted her attention.  She did not understand the
laughing sallies which flew back and forth, but their
merriment was so infectious that she smiled with them.
</p>

<p>
In Vienna the people were all of a type.  It was
easy for her to recognize a foreigner.  In Paris also,
the people resembled one another, so that she never
had any difficulty in distinguishing which were
French and which were of an alien race, but no two
of these Americans were alike.  They all wore
something of the same sort of clothes, but there the
resemblance ended.
</p>

<p>
Her curious eyes widened over the quantity of
jewelry several of the women wore, no matter what
the hour of the day.  One of the men in the party, a
tall, broad-shouldered individual, with a florid face
and a loud laugh, seemed to fill all his conversation
with uncomplimentary comparisons of the comforts
to be had in Europe with those at home.  His fellow
countrymen seemed to heartily agree with his sentiments.
</p>

<p>
One of the women, a stout, elderly person, who
boasted neither style nor figure, turned to Marie with
a question.  Marie shook her head, blushing.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Madame," she said, "I speak no English."
</p>

<p>
The shout of laughter from the other Americans
that greeted her answer, startled her, until, to her
confusion, she discovered that the elderly woman had
addressed her in what she fondly imagined was
French.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it all interesting?" laughed Marie, as
clinging to her tall husband's arm, they started for a walk
about the countryside.  Everything was wonderful
to her, and Gerome, watching the sun sparkle on her
hair and dance in her bright eyes found everything
wonderful too.
</p>

<p>
They explored the little town, wandered about in
all the out-of-the-way corners, took long rambles up
the mountain sides, and in the lovely June evenings,
sat on the tiny balcony, her cheek against his shoulder,
and watched the marvel of the gold, crimson and
purple sunsets among the giant peaks upflung
against the gleaming sky.
</p>

<p>
It was a perfect week, and when it drew to a close,
and they were leaving for Paris, their boxes and bags
strapped and ready in the hall below, in charge of the
green-aproned porter, Marie ran back to the room
in which she had been so happy.  She looked about
hastily and lovingly at the plain hotel furniture, the
wide, marble-topped dresser, the great chair on the
arm of which she had sat so often as Gerome smoked
his morning cigar.  She went about to each inanimate
object and patted it lovingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dear room," she whispered, "where I have been
so happy.  How I have loved each one of all these
things!"
</p>

<p>
The long windows were open, and she stepped out
for a moment onto the balcony.  She looked up at
the glistening <i>Jungfrau</i>.  Its majesty, its whiteness
filled her with wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful mountain," she said softly.  "You have
looked down on my happiness, I shall always
remember you."  Then she turned and went to meet Gerome
where he was waiting in the hall.
</p>

<p>
The proprietor of the hotel was at the door.  He
was a queer, thin little man who almost wept over
their hands as he bade them good-bye.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but you must not go, really, you must not go!
I am desolated to see you go," he said, and they would
probably have been highly flattered had they not
heard him say the same thing to each departing
guest.
</p>

<p>
Back in Paris, the Le Grands, Monsieur, Madame
and the two tall girls were at the little apartment in
the Avenue d'Antin to greet them.  They had
engaged Suzanne, Julie's younger sister, to come and
take charge of the small household, and she it was
who, very important and smiling in white cap and
apron, opened the door to the young couple when
they arrived.
</p>

<p>
The trip from Geneva had been a long dusty one,
and Marie was tired, but her joy was very real at
seeing these kind faces again.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur nearly shook Gerome's hand off and
patted him vigorously on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"We're glad you're both back," he rumbled.  "How
well you look, how brown!  Even Marie has been
kissed by the sun."
</p>

<p>
The two girls must show Marie everything.  She
must see her room with its dainty gray furniture, the
delicate lavender hangings.  She must be taken
into Gerome's room beyond.  Wasn't it charming?
Didn't she like the way it was arranged?  And the
white and gold salon, the tiny dining-room with its
shining silver and china.  The kitchen, wasn't it all
wonderful?
</p>

<p>
Marie let them lead her from room to room.  She
couldn't be too grateful, too happy.  Her dream was
growing in loveliness.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne had spread a dainty meal in the dining-room,
coffee, little cakes, wine and some cold meat
and rolls, and as they sat about the table, they all
chattered at once.
</p>

<p>
At last Monsieur looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
Dear me, how late it was, they mustn't keep these
tired travelers awake any longer.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne, all smiles, brought Madame's wrap and
the girl's coats.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur, his walking-stick under one arm and
Madame under the other, led the way out, after
kissing Marie resoundingly on both cheeks and patting
Gerome on the shoulder and telling him what a lucky
dog he was.
</p>

<p>
Later, Gerome came to the door of his wife's dainty
gray and lavender room.  She was letting down her
heavy golden braids, and the sleeves of her negligée
fell away from her white arms, as she raised them to
her hair.  She looked very lovely against the misty
background of the pretty room, and his eyes swept
her fondly.  She let her hair fall about her shoulders
and held her arms out to him.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest," she said, "welcome, welcome home!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome held her against his breast.
</p>

<p>
"My little Sainte Marie," he whispered.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
The little apartment in the Avenue d'Antin shone
like a carefully kept doll's house.  Marie, indulging
her fancy for dainty clothes, went about the tiny
rooms dressed in the prettiest frocks in her modest
<i>trousseau</i>.
</p>

<p>
There were visits back and forth between her
cousins and herself.  Fleurette and Sidonie spent long
afternoons with her, which she did her best to fill
with interest and enjoyment for them, getting out
her finest china for the afternoon chocolate.
They never ceased to wonder at her new dignity, her
staid little air of matronliness, secretly promising
themselves to copy it when they should be married.
When the time came for Julie to call for them, it
always seemed too soon, and Marie used to stand at
her window and wave good-bye to them till they had
turned the corner.
</p>

<p>
There were afternoons, too, when she would take
her sewing in a dainty reticule and go sedately up to
the apartment in the Avenue Victor Hugo.  Her life
was full and overflowing.  Occasionally Gerome would
bring one of his fellow-officers and his wife to dine,
and sometimes these visits were returned.
</p>

<p>
So the days slipped by, peacefully, calmly, each
filled with more happiness than Marie ever dreamed
life could hold.
</p>

<p>
Then into this peaceful, contented atmosphere,
gradually, imperceptibly, out of the nowhere, vague
rumors began to shape themselves.  A curious
palpitating unrest made itself felt.  The air seemed
charged with something strange, alive, too formless
to guess at, until one momentous day, that was to
stand forever a grim milestone in the world's history.
The papers were full of a terrible happening.  The
Austrian Archduke had been assassinated, a shot
had been fired at the royal carriage in a far-away
country.  Through the Paris streets, the news was
cried.
</p>

<p>
Intangible menace seemed to quiver in the air,
filling the heart with vague apprehensions of coming
danger, like the glare of a great conflagration that
is seen on the far horizon.
</p>

<p>
When she questioned her husband, he quieted her
fears, though his own brow was anxious.  This was
all too remote, it would never come near enough to
destroy.
</p>

<p>
There were long discussions over the little
dining-table when the Le Grands or any of Gerome's fellow
officers came to dine.  She heard her own Austria
discussed unfavorably.  She wondered that Germany,
whom she had always been brought up to look upon
as the Great Protector, should here be viewed as the
Arch-Conspirator, the Menacing Tyrant, bloodthirstily
eager to get the whole world in the grip of
its mailed fist.
</p>

<p>
Looking at her husband's uniform, it was brought
home to her, with a gasping fear, what war might
mean to her.  But Gerome, seeing the look in her eyes,
would reach across the table and pat her hand, and
Monsieur Le Grand would rumble his assurances that
everything would surely blow over, Germany was too
wise to set all Europe against her.
</p>

<p>
And then the distant conflagration seemed to grow
clearer.  It was as though the bright tongues of
flame one had only imagined, became suddenly visible,
leaping, advancing, devouring everything in their
course.
</p>

<p>
The formless something that had palpitated in the
air, took shape, and began to spell out the dread
word, "WAR."
</p>

<p>
Every hour extras came out with news.  Every
hour it was denied.
</p>

<p>
From the windows of the little apartment in the
Avenue d'Antin, Marie, with a white face, stood at
Gerome's shoulder, watching the bonfires blazing
where the police were burning the false newspapers.
</p>

<p>
"What does it all mean?" she shuddered.  "What
can it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
Gerome held her close.
</p>

<p>
"It may mean dreadful things, dear, we can only
wait and see," he told her.
</p>

<p>
She was frightened every moment he was away
from her, though the Avenue d'Antin was quiet and
peaceful.  On her way to visit the Le Grands, she had
seen the huge placards posted along the Boulevards
ordering the men to the <i>casernes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Gerome was with his regiment nearly always now,
and she was much alone.  Terror of what it might
mean, fear of she knew not what, enveloped her.
Here and there, she was beginning to hear the street
gamins shout out their hatred of the <i>Boches</i>.  Once
or twice they had called the name at her.  She began
to fancy she could even see in the kindly faces of her
cousins a certain resentment of her origin.
</p>

<p>
Once she had spoken to Fleurette in German, and
the girl had raised her arm as though warding off
a blow.
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak that language," she had cried, and
Marie, white-faced and wide-eyed, had looked into
their serious faces, terror-stricken.
</p>

<p>
It couldn't be true!  There couldn't be war!  To-day,
when mankind had grown so civilized, so filled
with a sense of culture as she had heard it preached,
it couldn't be true!  The Fatherland, her Austria,
and the country she had made her own?  It was too
horrible, too terrible to think of, it couldn't be!
These weren't the days of the dark ages!  This was
the enlightened twentieth century!  It would all blow
over!  It must!
</p>

<p>
Gerome soothed her.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, dear," he said seriously, "we are on the
edge of grave things.  I am not asking you to give
up your love for your home land, but your allegiance
belongs here now.  We must be very careful.  Everywhere
there is suspicion, distrust of those who are not
of our own blood.  We must be very cautious."
</p>

<p>
Marie threw herself into his arms, frightened at
his gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing matters but you," she said; "nothing!
There won't be war!  There can't be!  Nothing shall
take you away from me!"
</p>

<p>
Her husband shook his head sadly above her
trembling shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little one," he sighed, "there shouldn't be
war!  But there may be.  We must all do our best,
whatever comes!"
</p>

<p>
A few days later, came a wild letter from Paulette.
</p>

<p>
"What is Paris saying?" it began.  "What is
Paris doing?  Are we to let our country be overrun?
Our beloved France insulted, reviled?  Papa is
drilling men every day here at the <i>caserne</i>, and
Maurice is at home in Belgium now, but he will come
as soon as France needs him and fight for the flag
he loves almost as well as his own.  <i>Maman</i>, too, is
busy teaching the peasants what to do in case of the
worst.  Robert, the butler, has left to enlist if he is
needed, and we have a new man.  He is over age, they
do not need him to fight.  He seems very good.  Even
old Nanine is going to send her three sons.  Oh,
Gerome, my brother, I wish I were a man, so that I
could go with you and fight for France if she needs
me."  And then in a paragraph all by itself had
followed the line: "What about Marie&mdash;is she one
of us?"
</p>

<p>
Marie looked up startled from the letter Gerome
had handed her.
</p>

<p>
Paulette's vague distrust was voiced now.  She was
an alien, an enemy.  She seemed to hear the cries of
the street gamins, "<i>yah! Boche!</i>"  To her there was
neither France nor Germany, peace nor war.  There
was only Gerome, her husband.  He was her world,
her all, without him, Chaos!  It was all a horrible
nightmare; such things did not happen to-day.
Husbands would not leave wives who loved them, to fight
husbands of other wives who loved them equally well.
They were living in a civilized world, a world that
had outlived the horrors of Barbarian times.  Such
things did not happen!
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And then the sun had risen on the fourth of August
and Belgium lay ravished and bleeding.  The world
rocked and groaned and was torn asunder.  The
skies thundered to the echo and re-echo of devastating
guns.  One after another, the nations shook off the
security of peace, girded themselves in the red garb
of war, and clashed their shields one on the other.
Such things <i>did</i> happen!  Civilization had perished!
</p>

<p>
France was called to arms.  France was responding
with all the joyousness, the brilliancy with which she
had lived in peace.  France was lifting her proud
head, her brave, indomitable spirit against that
ever-advancing gray wall of deadliness, that gray
wall that for forty years, had builded and prepared
itself, had seen that no chink or cranny should be
left in it when The Day arrived.  And against this
menace, as it came closer and closer, France, pitifully
unprepared, unexpectedly called from her playtime,
was taking her stand, brave and full of the courage
of the right that knows no defeat.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere was the sound of the Marseillaise, the
tramp of marching feet.  Marie went with the Le
Grands to watch the soldiers pass along the Champs
Elysées.  The music of the band, as they swung
along, the fluttering tri-color that caught the sunlight,
the eager glow of patriotism shining from each
young face as it swept by, tightened her throat,
misted her eyes, and she found herself forgetting that
they were marching against her own people, her own
Fatherland.
</p>

<p>
She saw herself in each mother, each wife, each
sweetheart, trudging along by the side of the swinging
troops.  She felt her own heart bleed with these
weeping ones, sending their best to fight for what,
they loved more, La Patrie!  When she could bear
it no longer, she turned with streaming eyes and
begged Fleurette and Sidonie to take her home.
</p>

<p>
Gerome was not to leave yet, he had other work to
do; but she knew the day was not far distant when she
would be sending him out as those other mothers,
wives and sweethearts were doing.
</p>

<p>
The days swept on into those terrible ones, when
all Paris waited anxiously for the result of the battles
being waged, when all Paris shuddered with the
approach of invading feet.  Breathless excitement, wild
joy at the reports of victory, of the foe vanquished,
ran like wild-fire through the streets.  Then followed
those other rumors, alarming, terrible, later
confirmed by official reports.  The Army was falling
back!  The Enemy was advancing!
</p>

<p>
Gerome was with her less and less now.  Marie
kept safely hidden in her little apartment.  When he
came home, it was only for hurried, brief visits,
assurances that he would see to her safety, but that his
place and duty was with his regiment which had been
detailed to guard the city.
</p>

<p>
One morning, Marie was awakened by an ominous
rumbling, far away, deep-toned and menacing.
</p>

<p>
Suzanne ran in trembling with fright.
</p>

<p>
"Madame," she gasped, "it is the guns!  Do you
not hear them?"
</p>

<p>
She went to the window and looked down into the
street.  People ran past, terrified, shouting that the
city would be taken.  She saw some of her neighbors
leave their houses, with only such of their belongings
as they could conveniently carry with them.
</p>

<p>
Toward noon, the Le Grands came, dressed for
traveling, Madame's eyes were red with weeping, and
the two girls whimpered like frightened babies.
Monsieur, his swarthy face yellowish from a long night
of vigil and the knowledge of what this might mean
to Paris, bade Marie pack a few things and come
with them.
</p>

<p>
"We are leaving for Bordeaux," he said.  "The
Government has been moved there.  I go with my
office.  You must come with us, Marie, you will be
safer there."
</p>

<p>
Marie stared from one to the other, frightened.
</p>

<p>
"How can I go," she said.  "Gerome is with his
regiment at the Fortifications.  He bade me stay
here, close, indoors."
</p>

<p>
Nothing could move her, and weeping bitterly, the
girls clinging about her neck, and Madame kissing
her sadly, they said good-bye.
</p>

<p>
The cloud that hung over everything deepened,
grew blacker.  Terror, horror, and a dreadful
sorrow stalked the streets.  Defeat was approaching,
defeat by a foe who had once before marched
triumphantly down these broad avenues, under these
stately arches built as the memorial of a proudly
victorious nation.  Men and women stopped each
other in the streets, asking if this were going to
happen again.
</p>

<p>
Invasion, and all that it meant, hung like a black
pall over the city called the gayest, the happiest in
the world, covering, enveloping it with a dreadful
menace.
</p>

<p>
A tragic figure, Paris waited its doom.
</p>

<p>
Then, suddenly, across the blackness came a
message.  The enemy was halted.  Louder roared the
guns, but now, those who listened seemed to hear a
note of triumph in their fierce song, a shout that
bade them look up, take courage!  It was as though
the spirit of Jeanne d'Arc had again raised the
Oriflamme.
</p>

<p>
La Patrie lifted her head once more.  Bloody,
wounded, but proudly undaunted.
</p>

<p>
Another message!  The enemy was retiring!
</p>

<p>
The flower of France was sweeping onward!  Onward!
The tide had turned!
</p>

<p>
Through the streets, the people sang, shouted, wild
with joy.
</p>

<p>
A little stream had marked the high tide of
French patriotism and valor; a little stream that
would live in the memory of men as long as deeds
like these should be written or sung; a little stream
which would be forever after endeared to the hearts
and the minds of the French nation&mdash;the Marne!

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p>
In ghastly numbers, the wounded began pouring
into Paris, a sad and terrible procession.  About the
railroad stations, crowds were gathered.  Mothers,
sisters, wives, sweethearts were anxiously scanning
each pitiful burden as it was lifted into the waiting
ambulances, their hearts torn with the fear that this
might be the one they sought.  Strong men shook
with anguish at the terrible spectacle.  These
shattered wrecks, who had gone forth in the pride of
their youth and strength, fought, suffered, died,
so that Liberty might live, their wounds mutely
supplicating those who were to take their places not
to let their sacrifice be in vain.
</p>

<p>
As the stretchers were tenderly borne past the
waiting people, flowers were flung on the gray
blankets, there were cheers and suppressed sobs.  But
mingling with their tears was a feeling of exultant
pride that these man had saved their beloved country
from the humiliation of defeat, had kept hope still
alive for final victory.
</p>

<p>
The women of France, those wonderful women who
have always risen to every crisis in their country's
history flocked to give their services to her now.
</p>

<p>
With Gerome's permission, Marie offered her aid.
Her hands were deft and light, and her heart was full
of pity for these poor boys whom she had seen march
away so bravely, young, strong, and flushed with the
glow of eager patriotism.  She was filled with
compassion for these people of whom her marriage had
made her one, and she worked early and late among
them.  The fatigue that followed acted as a sort of
relief against the terrible anxiety with which she
was filled as to Gerome's safety, for now she never
knew where he was nor into what danger he was
going.
</p>

<p>
As an assistant nurse, she spent most of her time
in the hospitals, going from bed to bed, comforting,
consoling, doing as much as her limited training would
permit.  Her heart bled for the sightless eyes that
had so recently smiled back the sunlight; for the
useless stumps of arms that could never again hold
those they loved; for the helpless young giants shorn
of their strength forever.  As she went in and out
among the terrible flotsam tossed back by the tide
of battle, a wondering admiration for the people of
her adoption grew in her heart, for torn and racked,
bloody and shattered as they were, these men never
complained, there was never a word of discouragement.
Stronger than their suffering, stronger than
the thought of the helpless years ahead, was the joy
born of the knowledge that they had fought well and
bravely for what they loved most&mdash;La Patrie!
</p>

<p>
There was more than enough to do for all who were
willing to lend their aid.  Marie's heart was wholly
in her work, she toiled unremittingly.  She tried to
comfort those among her acquaintances whose dear
ones lay out beneath the little wooden crosses near
the Marne.
</p>

<p>
But although in the hospitals her gentle hand and
sweet face brought comfort to many a pain-racked
<i>poilu</i>, gradually among her own circle she seemed to
sense a widening breach, a rift in the love and
companionship that had always been given her.
</p>

<p>
One day she overheard Fleurette and Sidonie
discussing her.
</p>

<p>
"Marie is different," said the older, "she isn't
really one of the <i>Boches</i>, she belongs to us!"
</p>

<p>
"She was born there," the other had responded
doggedly, "and I heard papa say yesterday, 'Once a
German, always a German!'"
</p>

<p>
She went into their room immediately, and
carefully explained to them that all her love and
allegiance was with them; that she had given up her
own country with her marriage to Gerome, and was
now as loyally French as they.
</p>

<p>
But the tales of brutality, of wanton destruction
that were reported in Paris, the cruelty of these
people from whom she had sprung, were inconceivable to
her.  She couldn't believe them.  Once she voiced
these doubts to Gerome.
</p>

<p>
He put his hands on her shoulders and looked deep
into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said, "I'm afraid these things are
true.  It will be best for you to believe them, and to
forget that the blood of our enemies flows in your
veins!"
</p>

<p>
Once on her way home, she had seen an angry mob
stoning the windows of Herr Pappenheim's
<i>Rotisserie</i>.  Through the door she caught a glimpse of the
round face of the proprietor.  It was a pasty-white,
and there was a swollen lump over one eye where a
stone had struck him.  The windows were smashed
and yelling boys were pillaging among the appetizing
stores.
</p>

<p>
She heard the derisive shouts of "<i>Boches&mdash;yah, sale
Boche</i>," as the <i>gendarmes</i> dispersed the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Good Herr Pappenheim, who had so often winked
at a generous overweight for some needy customer,
and in the warm evenings had always sat happily on
the sidewalk before his shop, his fat German wife at
his side, and all the children in the neighborhood
climbing over his broad, good-humored shoulders!
And now, with this new feeling against his race, these
same children were stoning his windows!
</p>

<p>
The return of the government to Paris brought
the Le Grands with it.  Julie came with a note to the
Avenue d'Antin.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Marie," it said, "we are home again.  We
shall be very glad to see you when you can spare the
time!"
</p>

<p>
"Spare the time," she looked up startled.  The
formal phrasing worried her.  Were they too,
thinking of her as The Enemy?
</p>

<p>
"They don't trust me," she complained to Gerome
on one of his fleeting visits to her.  "They look at
me as though I am some strange creature that doesn't
belong here.  They&mdash;they whisper about me.
Yesterday, at the Red Cross rooms, I heard Madame
Dupin say I was an alien, and&mdash;and once or twice
they spoke about&mdash;about <i>spies</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome, weary with his long vigil and happy to be
with her again, drew her close in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he murmured, "I know it must be very
hard for you.  This sort of thing is one of the worst
phases of this war.  But you are one of us now!  It
is because you are a part of my beloved France, that
She means more to me than ever."
</p>

<p>
Marie nestled closer, her cheek against his brown
one.
</p>

<p>
"I am a part of France, dear, now and forever!"
</p>

<p>
She felt her words deeply, with a sense of elation
in the knowledge that she did belong to this wonderful
country whose children could sing their way happily
through the sunlit days of peace, and yet when
the sky grew overcast with war clouds that obscured
the sun and threatened to overwhelm her with destruction,
be ready to lay aside their playthings, turn
from their laughter and ease, and girding on their
armor, stand staunch and firm, fighting to the last
drop of their heart's blood.
</p>

<p>
In the faces about her, she read the exaltation that
must have lighted the countenance of the Maid of
Orleans, the determination that the proud head of
their beloved country should never be bowed beneath
a strange yoke.
</p>

<p>
She forgot Austria, forgot Germany, forgot her
alien blood, and gave her waking hours gladly,
unreservedly to be as useful as she could.
</p>

<p>
After the supply of trained nurses increased she
was set to making surgical dressings, and, as she
rolled the interminable yards of gauze, the room
would sometimes blur through her tears of sympathy
at the sad stories she heard.  But as more and more
of the terribly wounded kept pouring into the city,
the hatred and resentment against the enemy who
was causing all this suffering grew, and she began
to see a difference in the faces about her.  Women
who had been kind and friendly before, who had
politely ignored her foreign origin, now began openly
to show their disfavor.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when she entered the room filled with
women busy preparing supplies for the hospitals,
there would be a sudden cessation of conversation, as
though she had been the subject they were discussing.
</p>

<p>
As the days wore on, suspicion and distrust became
more open, friends of the Le Grands who knew her
origin, cut her as they passed her in the street, and
even her cousins asked her less and less to the
apartment in the Avenue Victor Hugo.
</p>

<p>
Marie's sensitive nature shrank from the aversion
about her.  She suffered keenly from the suspicion
directed against her.  So at last it was decided that
she would be safer at the Château de la Motte than
here in Paris where she must of necessity be so much
alone.  Tearfully, she closed the little apartment and
prepared to go to her husband's people.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<p>
To Paulette, the fourth of August meant the sudden
ending of all her happy anticipations, for, shortly
after the declaration of war, Maurice had been taken
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
When the news came to the château, she refused to
believe it; such a thing was impossible!  Maurice was
to fare forth and fight for France, he was to fly her
colors from his helmet as did the knights of old!  But
he had been obliged to fight the invaders of his own
country.  The Germans had come!  The Germans
had conquered!  Maurice was a prisoner!
</p>

<p>
Paulette had never known in all her short life what
denial meant.  To her parents, her word and whim
was law, and her brother idolized her.  Her every wish
had been gratified.  She insisted now that they
demand her lover's freedom.  She could not be made
to understand the futility of even asking.  It was
impossible that what she wanted so ardently, should
be kept from her.
</p>

<p>
There came a letter, meagre, bloodless, sternly
emasculated by the Teuton censor, but it contained
one word that sent the blood from her
lips&mdash;"Wounded."  Other letters followed, but they were
pitifully empty, so lacking in everything that she
wanted to know, that they were more a source of
grief than comfort.  After awhile, even these stopped.
</p>

<p>
Old Nanine, the Breton woman, who had nursed
Paulette and her brother, shook her head over the
shadows under her eyes, the listless droop of her
mouth, the hollows in the delicate oval of her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
The girl was filled with a flame of deep, bitter rage
that consumed her day and night.  The tears that
came to the relief of other women, were denied her.
Hate, that most terrible of the children of War, was
born in her breast.
</p>

<p>
"Now dearie," crooned Nanine, "don't take it like
that!  It can't be long before the French will have
driven the <i>Boches</i> away, and the young Monsieur will
be back again.  Come, calm yourself!  What a picture
you will be for him to see when he comes, if you
go on so."
</p>

<p>
But Paulette refused to be comforted.  The sunniness
of her nature changed into a brooding sullenness.
She grew to hate the very name of the Germans,
and little by little her resentment fastened itself
on Marie, her Austrian sister-in-law.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of her grief and despair, one day
one of her school friends, a girl of her own age, came
to the château.  She wore the white coif of the
trained nurse with its little red cross of mercy bound
about her forehead.  She was filled with wonderful
tales of bravery and suffering, and in a flash Paulette
knew that this was the work which would fill her
time and her heart while waiting for Maurice, and
perhaps enable her to help him.  She began to dream
that it might be her hands that would nurse him back
to health.  She must make those hands as skillful as
possible.  She threw herself into the necessary studies
with feverish energy.
</p>

<p>
Though the General had passed the retiring age,
he had been recalled to active service and was absent
most of the time.  When he did come home, it was
only for hurried visits.  The household was
completely changed.  One by one, those of the men
servants who were young enough, had been called to
the colors and had marched away.  Old Nanine had
seen her two eldest sons go, big, strapping fellows of
whom she was justly proud.  In company with so
many other French mothers, she had said good-bye to
them for the last time.  Jean had fallen in one of the
first skirmishes and Pierre had received his death
wound a few weeks later.  Now the youngest, Jacques,
had just left for the front.  Her heart was very
heavy, but she stifled her own sorrow to comfort the
grieving Paulette.
</p>

<p>
Madame de la Motte busied herself from early
morning to night, gathering supplies and looking
after the families of those who had gone with the
army.
</p>

<p>
Of the men about the château, none were left
excepting Joseph, the gardener, stooping under his
sixty heavy years, and the new butler.
</p>

<p>
This man was tall and thin, perhaps forty-five, his
hair graying at the temples, his dark, watchful eyes
looking out steadily from under heavy brows.  He
was so well spoken of in the letters of recommendation
which he presented, that Madame de la Motte
considered herself fortunate to have found him.
</p>

<p>
Antoine&mdash;this was his name&mdash;and old Nanine, did
not agree very well.  The Breton peasant distrusted
and disliked every one whose ancestry she did not
know.  Her broad, good-humored face would set in
wooden lines when she and Antoine encountered one
another, and if he took her to task about even the
smallest thing, she would shower upon him a volley of
sturdy Breton abuse.  So usually the mild and
quiet-spoken Antoine avoided her as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Nanine was a privileged character.  She came and
went as she pleased in the household, although her
own home was the gate house just at the entrance to
the château grounds.  Here she lived, with an orphan
girl named Angéle, who was to marry Jacques when
he came back from the war.
</p>

<p>
To this cottage of Nanine's, Paulette came nearly
every day.  She brought her letters as she received
them from Maurice, and the two girls would read
them over and over, Angéle pointing out where the
censor had blotted out a phrase, Paulette, through
her tears, trying to supply it.  And Jacques' letters
were gone over in the same way.  When the news
came that he, too, was taken prisoner and sent to
Belgium, they spent much of their time hoping that
he would be near Maurice, and so these two girls,
one at each end of the social scale, bridged the gap
that separated them and became one in a sorrow
common to both.  For grief, as well as war, knows no
caste.
</p>

<p>
Old Nanine, her wide Breton skirts billowing about
her, the huge wings of her great white Breton cap
framing her broad face, trudged back and forth with
Paulette on her errands among the peasants, her
heart heavy with the sorrow that comes to every
mother of men, when men are waging war.  She would
not trust the girl alone on her own familiar roads,
for the armies were nearing their quiet village.
</p>

<p>
So the days went by, those dreadful August days.
Into almost every household about them came the sad
news that some loved son who had marched away so
bravely, would never return.  The faces of the women
grew wan and sad.  Joy had gone from the world.
</p>

<p>
And now the air began to tremble with an ominous
intonation, a sound filled with grim menace that
continued day and night, a harbinger of death and
destruction, of devastation and terror.  A sound that
was never to cease in the long months that followed,
sometimes swelling into a deep, distant roar,
sometimes dying away in a dull, intermittent muttering.
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of the guns!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<p>
One day there came a letter from Gerome.
</p>

<p>
"I am bringing my wife to stay with you," it said.
"Paris is growing uncomfortable for her, for though
she is as loyal as I am myself, there are those who
are unkind because of her foreign birth.  I have leave
of absence, as I have important business to talk over
with you, my father, and so when I leave for the
front, I shall know that Marie is in the care of my
mother and Paulette.  We shall motor from here
sometime on Wednesday, and will probably be with
you Thursday evening.  Until then&mdash;&mdash;" and the
letter ended with the loving messages Gerome always
sent his parents, for he was a devoted son.
</p>

<p>
The General, home for a few days, read the letter
aloud, Madame closed her eyes quickly for a moment,
to hide the sudden mist that rose to them.
</p>

<p>
"I shall see my boy again," she said softly, but
Paulette, her face sullen, sat staring into space.
</p>

<p>
"It seems a long while since we saw him," said the
General, folding the letter, and putting it back into
his breast pocket, "and he must be off again almost
at once!"
</p>

<p>
His wife sighed wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"We must be grateful that we are to see even this
much of our son.  How many of our friends will never
see theirs again!"
</p>

<p>
Paulette swung about almost fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't only death that keeps them away!  Think
of the prisoners!  Oh, I wish I were a man!  To have
to sit here idly and wait, is maddening!"
</p>

<p>
She had finished her training and was daily expecting
her commission as a qualified nurse.  The inaction,
the waiting, was wearing her already suffering
nerves to a wire edge.
</p>

<p>
Her mother cast a quick glance at the General and
reaching over, put a gentle hand on the girl's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear child," she began, but Paulette went on
almost fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I feel as though I shall go mad thinking
of Maurice, a prisoner in some filthy place,
suffering from his wound, with perhaps not even enough
to eat!"  She bowed her head on the arm of her
chair and began weeping bitterly.
</p>

<p>
The General, helpless as so many men are in the
sight of a woman's suffering, paced the room with
long, military steps, his hands clutching each other
behind his back, his lower lip pursed out under his
mustache.
</p>

<p>
Madame tried to comfort the weeping girl.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," she said, "you must be calm, your
brother and Marie will arrive at any moment."
</p>

<p>
The girl sprang to her feet, her eyes flashing, her
lips drawn back from her white teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Why did Gerome ever marry her?" she cried.
"Why do we have to have her with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," chided her mother, "she is your
brother's wife."
</p>

<p>
The General stopped a moment in his pacing.
</p>

<p>
"He returns to the front to-morrow," he said.
"She must not be left unprotected.  It is not her
fault that she was born on the other side."
</p>

<p>
But the girl's pent-up emotion would have expression.
</p>

<p>
"Who was she?" she demanded.  "What was she?
We know nothing of her, nothing, excepting that she
came from Vienna, and God knows, we have no cause
to love anyone who comes from there!"
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," sighed her mother, "you hurt me, dear,
when you talk like that"; and the General added,
stern for the first time in his life to this beloved child
of his: "Paulette, you must promise me you will be
kind to your brother's wife."
</p>

<p>
The girl still faced them defiantly, her breast
heaving with the sobs she was trying to repress.
</p>

<p>
"How can I?" she cried.  "How can I bear any
good will to one of those fiends who are responsible
for all the suffering of Maurice, for all this terrible
agony!"
</p>

<p>
Madame's eyes were misty as she looked into the
drawn face which for the moment, rage had robbed
of all its charm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear child," she said softly, "Marie is not to
blame."
</p>

<p>
"She is, she is, I hate her!" and sobbing hysterically,
Paulette turned and ran from the room.
</p>

<p>
The General shook his head sadly as he looked
after her.
</p>

<p>
"One of the terrible evils of war," he said, "is that
it engenders hatred and prejudice that live for
generations after the war is over."
</p>

<p>
He paced the room thoughtfully.  Now and then
he let his eyes rest fondly on Madame as she bent
over her knitting.  The quiet, the air of peace that
seemed to surround them was in sharp contrast to the
distant rumbling where war's savage work was
going on.
</p>

<p>
He had spent his days after retiring from the
army, here at his château, cultivating its lands,
planting his vineyards, receiving from life what was to
him its most treasured possession, peace and contentment.
</p>

<p>
When the children grew up, and Gerome, following
his father's career, entered the army, the General
revived his youth in his son's letters, while Madame
watching Paulette's romance grow and ripen, relived
her own love story.
</p>

<p>
They were the spirit of that people whose civilization
had been measured by the hearth and roof-tree,
whose love of the home was the nucleus of that
impassible barrier which had opposed the Romans and
beaten back Attilla's advancing hordes, and who,
now that the enemy was again clamoring at their
gates, were prepared to prove that the spirit of their
fathers' still lived and would fight to the last drop
of their blood to preserve that most sacred thing in
the hearts of all people&mdash;Home!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
</h3>

<p>
Paulette, when she left her parents, threw a scarf
about her shoulders and ran across the courtyard to
the gate house.  She longed for the sympathetic love
of old Nanine, on whose bosom she had always found
consolation.
</p>

<p>
The long summer twilight was graying off into
night, and the tall black poplars above the garden
wall showed black against the darkening sky.  From
the low window, thrown open to the soft night air,
came a yellow shaft of lamp-light that lay in a square
patch on the neat gravel walk.
</p>

<p>
As Paulette's small heels crunched against the pebbles,
a figure suddenly started out of the shadows and
a man's voice called softly:
</p>

<p>
"Who comes?"
</p>

<p>
The girl drew back, startled.
</p>

<p>
"It is I, Paulette," she answered.  He came closer
and Paulette stared unbelievingly into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mam'selle," answered the man, grinning
broadly, "from Belgium&mdash;from prison!"
</p>

<p>
The girl gave a quick gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Captain le Cerf&mdash;what of him?"
</p>

<p>
"I have news of him, Mam'selle, but I must
report to the General first!"
</p>

<p>
Paulette swayed, and put out her hand to steady
herself against the wall.
</p>

<p>
"Maurice!" she whispered the name under her
breath as though half afraid of what the news might
be.  "Tell me!  Quick!" but Jacques shook his head
stolidly.
</p>

<p>
"First the General," he said, and turning on his
heel, started toward the house.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing for her to do but follow.  At
the door he stood aside to let her pass.
</p>

<p>
"Will you tell your father I am here, Mam'selle?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Give me my news," she begged.
</p>

<p>
"What I have to say must be said to the General,
Mam'selle," and Paulette, the daughter of a soldier,
knew he was right.  But she was trembling and
breathless when she opened the salon door.
</p>

<p>
Her mother was still sitting as she had left her in
the chair near the table, her hands in her lap, the
lamp-light accentuating the silver of her hair.  Her
eyes were closed and there were weary shadows under
them.
</p>

<p>
The girl went softly to her side and laid a loving
hand on her shoulder.  The knowledge that she soon
was to have news of Maurice, had softened her heart
for a moment, and driven out the bitterness she felt.
</p>

<p>
Madame opened her eyes with a start.
</p>

<p>
The girl's cheeks were flushed, the hand on her
mother's shoulder shook.  Madame looked at her
apprehensively.
</p>

<p>
"What is it!" she asked.  These were days when
the most insignificant happenings might have the
direst foreboding.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques is back!  He is in the hall.  He is waiting
to see father!"
</p>

<p>
Madame rose hastily to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques?  Is it possible?"
</p>

<p>
"It is, mother!  He is here!  He has news of
Maurice!"
</p>

<p>
At the sound of her excited voice, the General
opened the door of his study.
</p>

<p>
Paulette waited for no more than the question in
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques is here," she cried, "he is waiting to see
you!  Oh, father, ask him quickly his news from
Maurice!"
</p>

<p>
The General looked from one to the other in
surprise as the boy entered and stood at attention.
</p>

<p>
The girl clung to her father's arm, and Madame
smiled kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I understand you were a prisoner," began the
General.
</p>

<p>
In the full light of the lamp, they could see how
loosely the young soldier's dusty uniform hung on his
square shoulders.  The skin across his cheek-bones
was tightly stretched, and there were lines about his
mouth that must have come from suffering.  His chin
was blue with a week's growth of beard.
</p>

<p>
"I have a message from Captain le Cerf," he said.
</p>

<p>
Paulette clung to her father's arm, trembling with
expectation.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked the General patting the shaking
hand reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"It's a long story, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"Tell it in your own way, then," he said, motioning
him to a chair.
</p>

<p>
Jacques seated himself stiffly, and began.
</p>

<p>
"We were prisoners in the same camp!  It was just
outside Liège.  Soon after I got there, I saw the
Captain.  He had been wounded."
</p>

<p>
Paulette, her eyes black and burning in her white
face, followed every word with pitiful eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"I was given permission to take care of him.
There was an English nurse there.  She was very kind
to the prisoners.  She told us how it would be possible
for some of us to get away.  We made our plans, and
yesterday, two others and myself got across the
border.  The Captain would have come also if he had
been strong enough, but he will be here soon," he
hastened to add, when he saw the look in the girl's
eyes, "and when it has all been arranged, a message
will be sent to Division Headquarters at St. Quentin,
giving the name of the town and the time when he
will reach the frontier."
</p>

<p>
Paulette was shaking with emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Escape!" she breathed.  "If he only can!"
</p>

<p>
What a vindication of her pride in Maurice this
would be.  To escape, to show the Germans how futile
their efforts were to hold him.  Her eyes sparkled
and the blood surged to her cheeks.  To trick the
hated enemy that held him, what a triumph!
</p>

<p>
Then she thought of his wound, and her momentary
elation left her.  Fear returned.
</p>

<p>
"Is he better?  Are you sure he is better?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mam'selle, or I would not have left him!"
</p>

<p>
Madame rose.
</p>

<p>
"I must tell Nanine," she said, "that her son is
here!"  She rang, and after a brief interval came the
old woman's knock.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, the Breton peasant woman stood
facing them, then with a glad cry, she stumbled
toward the young soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques," she cried, and the joy and love in her
voice brought a lump into the boy's throat.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he said huskily, as she rocked him in her
stout old arms, "Mother!"
</p>

<p>
Nanine was oblivious of the presence of the others.
She was the first mother, the primeval woman with
her child.  The maternal love that goes out alike
from high and low, from civilized and savage, was
in her voice and eyes.
</p>

<p>
Presently she held him away from her.
</p>

<p>
"I knew they couldn't keep you," she said fondly.
"I knew you'd find your way back to me.  Are you
well?  Did they give you enough to eat?" she turned
to the others.  "He always wanted such a lot to eat!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques grinned sheepishly.  His mates too, had
found this out.
</p>

<p>
Paulette broke in eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about Captain le Cerf, was he comfortable?
Were they kind to him?"
</p>

<p>
The old woman looked at her, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying, Mam'selle?  Did the good
Lord bring them together?"
</p>

<p>
Jacques nodded and turned to the General.
</p>

<p>
"We were all well treated.  The hardest part was
not getting any news.  They told us things were
going against us, but we knew they were lying."
</p>

<p>
His mother's eyes devoured him.
</p>

<p>
"How were you taken?" asked the General.
</p>

<p>
"Four others and myself were detailed one night
to cut some barbed wire.  Their star-shells discovered
us to the <i>Boches</i>.  Three of our men went down, the
other and myself were captured and taken to a prison
camp in Belgium.  Among the prisoners the men and
officers are kept separated, but one day when I was
doing some of the work they had set me at, I recognized
Captain le Cerf as he passed near me with a hospital
orderly.  I suppose you've heard that he was
taken in the first attack on Liège.  He'd been in the
hospital a long time when I got there, as his wound
had been serious.  You will be glad to know, my
General, that in Belgium there is a band of men and
women whose good work it is to try and smuggle
French prisoners and their own men of military age,
out of the country.  There's an English nurse&mdash;one of
God's angels we call her&mdash;who is at the head of this
band.  She's helped a lot of us.  But you see, when it
came to Captain le Cerf's turn to be helped to escape,
he was still so weak it was impossible for him to make
the attempt.  I was next, so it was arranged that if
I got through the lines, I was to bring you word that
you might expect him.  They're going to get him
across as soon as they can!"
</p>

<p>
"When&mdash;where?" broke in Paulette.
</p>

<p>
"That I cannot tell, Mam'selle.  The next man
that is passed through will know the exact time and
place where Captain le Cerf will reach our lines!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said the General.  "Now tell us how you
made your own escape."  And Jacques, a little
nervously, though proud of his momentary importance,
launched into his story.
</p>

<p>
"This English nurse was to give me all the
particulars, but so that I could get near her, I had to
be in the hospital, and I'm a pretty healthy man,"
his shoulders squared a little.  "I was given some
medicine and told to take it and pretend to be sick."  He
made a wry face at the memory.  "I didn't have
to pretend.  They got me to the hospital, and while
their doctor was near, my nurse was just like
any other nurse, but as soon as he left, she leaned
over me and whispered my instructions.  You know,
sir, that the nurses have to report all deaths; well,
I was to die&mdash;and when I came to again, she'd have
a <i>Boche</i> driver's uniform ready for me.  That night
they smuggled me out.  As far as those <i>Boches</i> know,
I'm lying out under one of their little crosses.  I
reported where I was told to, as an ambulance driver.
My uniform and accent were unquestioned, and I was
put in charge of an ambulance and detailed to pick
up the wounded.  A man can feel as sorry for a
wounded <i>Boche</i> as for one of his own, and an ambulance
driver sees a lot of suffering.  I had to make
many trips before the time came when our <i>Poilus</i>
came charging across No Man's Land.  I was in the
front trench with my stretcher-bearer at the time.
When I saw our men coming, I pretended to be
wounded, and dropped.  They took the trench.  I
tore off as much of the field gray as I could
and told them who I was.  I was ordered to report
to my own regiment, and my commanding officer sent
me here!"  Jacques told his story with the simple
directness of the man whose life is action, not words.
Paulette had followed eagerly.  Her mother's eyes
were wet as she listened.  Old Nanine, her ample
bosom rising and falling with the breathless wonder
that this son, who was still a child to her, had come
through so much, murmured half aloud, a little
prayer of thanks for his safety.
</p>

<p>
The General nodded his approval.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" he said.  "Report yourself to Colonel
Rambeau at St. Quentin.  Tell him when word comes
from Captain le Cerf, that my orders are that you
are to bring it here immediately.  Be careful with
it, it is important that it does not get into other
hands."
</p>

<p>
Jacques saluted.
</p>

<p>
"I shall leave word that you may come directly to
Mademoiselle," continued the General, smiling
indulgently on his daughter.  "That is all."
</p>

<p>
"Nanine," said Madame, rising, "you must want
to talk to your boy."
</p>

<p>
As the mother and son hurried along the path to
the gate house, the door opened, and Angéle appeared
in the shaft of a light that poured out.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stood and watched them, and
then with a cry, ran and threw her arms wildly
about the boy's neck.
</p>

<p>
Nanine turned with a sigh and went into the house,
leaving the girl to sob in her sweetheart's arms, and
it was some time before she called:
</p>

<p>
"Come in, Jacques is hungry!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
</h3>

<p>
After the door had closed on Nanine and her son,
the General patted the brown head resting on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it glorious news, Paulette?"
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderful how cheaply these men hold their
lives," Madame said musingly.  "Chances that would
have seemed madness in normal times have now become
part of the day's work."
</p>

<p>
Paulette nestled closer in her father's arms.  "If
he only reaches the frontier safely," she murmured,
"if he only is not discovered and taken back."
</p>

<p>
Madame's face was sad as she comforted the girl.
Her own sorrow and foreboding were kept close shut
in her heart.  But self-command is measured by those
rare occasions when the evidence of inward struggle
is seen through the cloak of restraint.  Something of
what she felt, shook for a moment her outward calm,
trembled in her voice, shone through the sudden mist
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Poor <i>Maman</i>," said Paulette, "you have so much
to think of!  I have been a selfish little beast!"
</p>

<p>
The gilt clock on the mantle chimed out nine.
It would soon be time for Gerome to arrive.  She
remembered with what happiness she had always
looked forward to his visits, their days of
comradeship.  Now all this was to be changed.  She knew
she was unjust.  But still there lingered in her heart
the resentment against this stranger whom she
instinctively distrusted.  If her brother might only
have been coming alone.  All his time must now be
given to this woman of alien blood.  She knew she
was unjust, that she had no grounds on which to base
her dislike, excepting the fact that she belonged to a
nation which was at war with her own.  Her thoughts
were interrupted by the honking of a motor-horn, and
the swift-following sounds of clutching brakes and
mingling voices.
</p>

<p>
"Here they come now," she cried, her anger and
bitterness against Marie, which she had tried to
crush, surging back.
</p>

<p>
Madame rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Ring for Antoine to get their bags," she said
quickly.
</p>

<p>
Paulette pulled the old-fashioned bell rope that
hung by the mantle, and then turned and stood
staring sullenly into the fire.
</p>

<p>
The General hurried to the long windows and threw
them open.  He could see the white light of the
motor lamps cutting a path through the darkness.
Gerome's voice, as he gave orders to the chauffeur,
came to him clearly, and presently he saw him come
swinging along the terrace, the light from the window
brightening the colors of his uniform.  Marie,
swathed in motor veils and wrapped in a heavy coat,
clung to his arm.  The lamp light silhouetted the
General's fine figure and Gerome called gayly as he
saw him.
</p>

<p>
"Here we are, father!" and he stood aside to let
Marie enter.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stood in the window, almost
afraid to venture in.  All the way from Paris, she had
been torturing herself with the thought of how her
husband's people would receive her, how much they
would let the knowledge of her enemy blood mar
their love for her.  She looked about her apprehensively,
but the General's kind voice dispelled her fears.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter," he said as he led her in, "welcome
home!"
</p>

<p>
Marie threw back her veils, their soft gray
framing her sweet face and golden bands of hair.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Madame, "how happy we are to
have you with us!"
</p>

<p>
"You are all so good to take me in," faltered the
girl, her eyes full of tears.  Gratefully, she looked
from one to the other, and turning to Paulette,
smiled wistfully into the handsome face, but Paulette's
greeting was ungracious and perfunctory, and the
smile died on Marie's lips.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's arm was about his mother's shoulders.
She drew his head down to hers and kissed him
tenderly, and then turned to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Come dear, rest here," she said with sweet
hospitality.  "You must be tired after your long ride
from Paris."
</p>

<p>
Marie sank into the chair the General brought
forward for her.
</p>

<p>
"There has been so much to weary me," she sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear, we all realize that, and each of us, in
his own way, has tried to lighten the burden," and
Madame helped the girl unfasten her wraps.
</p>

<p>
"It is good to be here," Marie looked about her
gratefully, "it's&mdash;it's almost like peace again."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would be happy," said Gerome,
coming over and sitting on the arm of her chair.  "I
told you they would be glad to have you with them."
</p>

<p>
The General beamed upon her.  In the code of the
gallant old soldier, a pretty woman was meant to be
taken care of.
</p>

<p>
"We will do our best to make you feel at home with
us," he assured her.
</p>

<p>
"And to make you happy," added Madame; but
at her words, Marie broke down.
</p>

<p>
"Happy?" she sobbed, "how can I be happy?  He
is going away to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Gerome turned helplessly to his mother.
</p>

<p>
"What can I do for her?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," and the General patted Marie's
hand, "we each have our part to do, my child," and
then for the first time, Paulette joined in the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
"You are not the only one who is sending some one
to fight the enemy."  She flung the word at Marie
as though it were her own name, and her sister-in-law
cowered under it.
</p>

<p>
Gerome was angry.  He had foreseen trouble with
Paulette, but had hoped that the assurance of his
wife's loyalty, would have banished all resentment.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette&mdash;&mdash;!" he began, but his mother interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind, dear," she said softly.  "Paulette's
heart is in Belgium.  Maurice is still a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked at her pityingly.  She could
understand.  She remembered the young, laughing-eyed
officer who had been so kind at her wedding.  She
remembered the happiness of these two young people,
and her heart bled for Paulette.  But the girl looked
at her defiantly, ignoring the pity in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"They'll find they can't keep him!" she said so
bitterly, that the General hastened to break in.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ring for Antoine to help you with your bags."
</p>

<p>
He was about to pull the bell-rope, when the door
opened and the butler stood on the threshold.  His
thin shoulders stooped slightly with characteristic
deference.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of his voice, Marie felt a horrible fear
gripping at her heart.  Her throat seemed to tighten
as though cold fingers clutched it.  She turned
slowly, the blood in her veins suddenly frozen, for the
man standing in the doorway wearing the livery of
a servant, the humility of a menial, was Von Pfaffen.
</p>

<p>
For a tense moment they faced one another.  The
man's eyes were like live coals in a face that was
otherwise dead.  Marie's hand went to her throat.
There was such a look of terror in her face, that the
attention of all was directed to her, and the butler's
imperturbable mask, which for one swift moment had
slipped aside, had time to adjust itself.  He stood
watching her closely, as the family gathered about,
all solicitude.
</p>

<p>
"She is faint," cried Madame, "some water&mdash;quick!"
but Marie motioned them away.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she said breathlessly.  "It is nothing!
Thanks!" and by a supreme effort, she regained her
self-control.
</p>

<p>
The butler was still standing in the doorway
quietly waiting for his orders, his thin face set and
expressionless.
</p>

<p>
"Get Madame's bags, Antoine," directed the General,
and the man turned with a slight bow and left
the room.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's eyes followed him.
</p>

<p>
"What has become of François?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"François was young enough to be called," the
General answered.  "He left us a week ago."
</p>

<p>
"Antoine came to us highly recommended,"
Madame assured him, disturbed for a moment by the
doubt in his eyes.  "He is over age for the army, but
seems an intelligent, faithful servant."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, the man returned carrying the bags,
and stood awaiting orders.
</p>

<p>
"Where are these to go, Madame?" he asked
quietly, and at his voice, Marie again turned and
stared into his face, like a bird that watches a snake.
</p>

<p>
The man paid no heed to her, however, but waited
respectfully for Madame to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Put them in the East room, Antoine," she told
him, and with a slight inclination of his head, he
crossed the room and went out into the hall.
</p>

<p>
Marie's eyes followed him, her lips apart, her
fingers tightly clenched.
</p>

<p>
Paulette, from her chair by the mantel, where she
had subsided after the speech flung at her sister-in-law,
watched her under sullen brows.  She hated
Germans.  They couldn't make her like this one.  She
wouldn't!
</p>

<p>
As the door closed after Antoine, Marie gave a
little gasp, and Madame, frightened, came to her
side.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," she said, "are you ill?"
</p>

<p>
The girl's eyes were still on the door.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" she began, and then turned piteously
to her husband.  "Oh, Gerome!"
</p>

<p>
The blow had come so suddenly, so unexpectedly.
She felt as one stricken blind, groping in the
dark.  This man, here, where she had come for
protection and shelter?  Her mind could scarcely
grasp the full horror of the situation.  Waves of
nausea passed over her, she was sick with unutterable
terror.  Was it possible they could not hear the wild
beating of her heart, the voice of conscience crying
her guilt?  Surely those about her must have seen
that she knew him!  The security into which she had
lulled herself, was shattered and fallen away.  But
why had he not recognized her?  What mission had
he here in this house?  Oh, God, how was it to end?
But her brain refused her further service.  Her face
grew white as marble, and her head fell on Gerome's
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He put his arm about her quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, my darling, what is it?  Mother, bring
some cognac!  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
Madame hurried for the decanter, the General bent
over her, full of solicitude, even Paulette, stirred into
action by Marie's helplessness, knelt at her side, and
began chafing her wrists, her training as a nurse
making her forget her resentment for the moment.
As Gerome held the glass to his wife's lips, her blue
eyes opened mistily.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said anxiously.  "What is it?  Are
you better?"
</p>

<p>
She roused herself with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing&mdash;nothing; I'm all right now&mdash;I'm
sorry&mdash;I suppose I was over-tired," and she leaned
wearily against his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"She has not been quite strong, lately," he
explained, "she is nervous, worrying because I must
return to the front to-night."
</p>

<p>
"To-night!" said his mother, startled, "so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>ma mère</i>," he answered, smoothing his wife's
golden hair tenderly; "but," and he turned to his
father with a significant look, "I shall be here again
in the morning."
</p>

<p>
The General pursed up his lips and tapped them
with his forefinger.
</p>

<p>
"H'm," he said, "so I supposed&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;h'm!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome bent over his wife tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Are you well enough to go to your room now,
dear?  I think you will feel better if you lie down!"
</p>

<p>
"Nanine will bring you some refreshments," added
Madame.
</p>

<p>
Marie forced a smile to her stiff lips.
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind," she said.  "I&mdash;I'll go
directly.  I'm quite well now.  I'm sorry to have been
so much trouble!"
</p>

<p>
Madame gently pressed her hand.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, "it gives us pleasure to do
all we can for you.  You must rest and when you have
recovered from your fatigue, here, in our wonderful
country air, you will soon be yourself again!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome looked about the room.  His mother's eyes
smiled back into his.  He had seen approval of Marie
in the General's face when they had arrived, but
Paulette was still unwon.  What could he do to
overcome this dislike that his sister was making so
apparent?  He felt sure that if he were near,
Paulette could soon be made to see her injustice, but
he must leave Marie, and the thought troubled him.
His arm tightened about the trembling girl.
</p>

<p>
"There is no other place where I could leave my
little wife," he said.  "You can't, any of you, know
what she means to me!"
</p>

<p>
"When you made her your wife, you made her our
daughter," said Madame graciously.
</p>

<p>
Gerome laid his cheek against his wife's, his eyes
on Paulette.
</p>

<p>
"You and Marie must be great friends, little
sister," he said; but Paulette shrugged sullenly, and
Marie hastily broke in:
</p>

<p>
"She is unhappy, dear, because her sweetheart is
a prisoner."
</p>

<p>
The last word whipped Paulette's resentment
again.  She would take no pity from an enemy.
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner," she repeated, "held by the Germans,"
and she swung about angrily; "but he's going
to get away, he's coming back to me in spite of them!"
</p>

<p>
"Paulette!" the General was stern, "I must beg of
you&mdash;" and Madame turned to Gerome in apology.
</p>

<p>
"She is unhappy, dear," she explained.
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted her head from Gerome's shoulder and
drew away from his arms.
</p>

<p>
"I can understand, I know what you are suffering,"
she said tensely.  "If Gerome were in the position
of Maurice, if he were forcibly withheld from me,
I would hate, as you do, those who were responsible.
I am of the same blood as they, but I am just as loyal
to my husband's cause as you are.  Don't you believe
me?"
</p>

<p>
Gerome looked at her fondly.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't she wonderful?" he asked.  "Am I not the
most fortunate of men?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not believe that anyone who has the blood
of our enemies in their veins, can ever be truly loyal
to France!" said Paulette, and this time, her momentary
courage gone, Marie hid her face on her husband's
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," said Madame, "I am shocked!  You
grieve me beyond expression!"
</p>

<p>
The General looked at his daughter in astonishment,
this was carrying things too far.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's face flushed under his tan and a dangerous
light came into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," he said passionately, "Marie is my
wife&mdash;your sister," and he turned to comfort the
trembling girl in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Madame drew her away tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Come, dear," she said, "you are tired.  Let me
show you your room.  Paulette, you had best go to
yours, you are nervous.  To-morrow you will be
yourself."
</p>

<p>
The girl's face flushed.  They were treating her as
a bad child.  Rising hastily, she hurried out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
Gerome kissed his wife tenderly as he bade her
follow his mother.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye for awhile, dear," he said.  "I'll come
to you when I have talked with my father."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
</h3>

<p>
The night was warm for October, and a late moon
was just rising.  The garden seemed so peaceful, only
the distant muttering of the guns constantly
reminded one that not far away the Red Dragon lay
in wait, its maw insatiable.
</p>

<p>
Must all the youth, the beauty of France, be
offered up, before this monster was satisfied?  Would
this home with its pleasant orchards, its fertile
gardens, be trampled under ruthless heels, laid waste as
so many others had?  And when it was all over, and
nothing remained but smoking ruins and wasted
fields, deep scars on the country's breast that time
itself could scarcely heal, when all the youth and
flower had become only a memory to be cherished in
the bitter hearts of a saddened people, what then?
What would have been accomplished?  Could any
price that might be paid to the victor, be great
enough to compensate for this?
</p>

<p>
Some such thoughts as these went through the
General's mind as he turned from the window to his
son.  This son, the very apple of his eye, how much
longer would that eye behold him?
</p>

<p>
Gerome came to the table.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir?" he began.
</p>

<p>
The General led the way into his study.
</p>

<p>
"We can talk more freely here," he said.
</p>

<p>
They had scarcely entered, when the butler followed
with a tray of glasses and a decanter of wine.
</p>

<p>
"Anything else to-night, Monsieur?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The General filled a glass.
</p>

<p>
"No, Antoine, that is all.  You may close the windows.
The Colonel will see that the door is latched
as he goes out."
</p>

<p>
The man busied himself with the fastenings.
</p>

<p>
"They are to meet here to-morrow," began Gerome,
but his father, with a lift of his eyebrow, indicated
the butler who was just finishing his task.
</p>

<p>
"Tst!" he said warningly, and then to the man,
"That will do, Antoine."
</p>

<p>
He bowed with that oddly quiet air of his.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Monsieur, good-night," he said, and
went out softly, but whether by accident or design,
the door he closed after him, failed to catch and
remained ever so slightly ajar.
</p>

<p>
Gerome was impatient to impart his information,
and the man had scarcely gone, when he began.
</p>

<p>
"I have been given orders to notify the commanding
officers of all the brigades of our division to meet
here to-morrow," he said.  "I must leave for
St. Quentin to-night."
</p>

<p>
"The others have been informed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!"
</p>

<p>
The General tapped his pursed lips with his
forefinger as he always did when thinking.
</p>

<p>
"H'm," he said, "by nine they should all be here."
</p>

<p>
"I have also been instructed to hand you this."  Gerome
took a folded paper in a long blue cover from
his pocket and put it into his father's hand, much as
though he were handing him the wealth of the world.
"It is the plan of location of our batteries."
</p>

<p>
"This is very important, my boy," said the General,
as he took the packet.  "I wonder what their
intelligence bureau would say if they could get their
hands on this?  Let us study the situation."
</p>

<p>
He pulled open a drawer and took out a leather
case.  They drew up chairs on either side of the
table, and under the lamp light, the two heads,
father's and son's, bent over the maps which the
General unrolled.
</p>

<p>
The room was silent as they studied the drawings.
Only the clock on the mantel, ticking out the passing
minutes and the occasional rustle of the papers, broke
the stillness.  They were both too absorbed to have
heard the sound, if there had been a sound to hear,
of the door behind them, as it slowly opened the
merest trifle, too intent on their work to see the lean
face of Antoine as it peered through, the meekness
gone from the watchful eyes, the humility from the
thin, hard lips.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we can make this blow a decisive one," said
Gerome.
</p>

<p>
The General flattened his finger over a spot on the
map and referred to the papers his son had brought.
</p>

<p>
"It is about here, I would say," he began.
</p>

<p>
Gerome looked at him in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that one of the most strongly fortified parts
of their line?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"And therefore, the place where attack will be
least expected."
</p>

<p>
Gerome nodded, and the General went on.
</p>

<p>
"Our artillery is being heavily engaged along the
whole line, but it is at this point," and his finger
tapped the map, "that the infantry will be massed
for the thrust."
</p>

<p>
"How many men will be used?" asked Gerome, leaning
closer to study the situation.
</p>

<p>
"About five corps with the necessary reserves."
</p>

<p>
The young Colonel leaned back in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"It seems logical," he said, "it should succeed."
</p>

<p>
The face behind them smiled evilly and melted into
the darkness back of it, and as quietly as it had
opened, so quietly the door was closed.
</p>

<p>
"It's a hard game we've been playing," said the
General, "but we are holding them now.  They have
taught us a great deal, but if this plan results as we
hope," the great head went up triumphantly, "it is
the beginning of the end!"  His face lit up with a
proud smile.  "You will be the youngest officer here
to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I am honored to be present at a conference that
may decide the fate of France," said Gerome
earnestly, as he rose.
</p>

<p>
His father pushed back the maps, rose to his feet,
and laid a hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My boy," he said, and his voice was full of love,
the love that a fine father gives to a fine son, "I
believe you are worthy of the honor.  Now go and kiss
your pretty wife good-night.  You have a long ride
before you.  I am going into the garden to smoke."
</p>

<p>
Gerome looked into the kindly old eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, sir!" he said, his shoulders squared
to meet the trust he saw there.  "Good-night."
</p>

<p>
For a moment after his son had gone, the General
stood under the lamp-light looking over the papers,
his shaggy brows were pulled down over his eyes, his
lower lip pursed out.  There was a wordless prayer
in his heart, that this might be the end.  Soldier
though he was, born and bred to the sword, the red
flood that was sweeping the world was nauseating,
sickening.  He, like many others, as bravely fighting,
as unflinchingly facing the storm of war, longed for
the peace that must come.
</p>

<p>
He started to roll the paper with his maps in their
case, but suddenly he stopped, reconsidering, and
shaking his head, placed the case carefully in his
pocket.  This was of too much importance to be
trusted away from his keeping.  From the humidor
on the table he carefully selected a cigar, bit off the
end, and lit it leisurely, then opening one of the long
windows, strolled out into the garden to think as he
smoked.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
</h3>

<p>
The light of the General's cigar had scarcely
disappeared when the door opened softly, and a head
was cautiously thrust in.  After a careful look about,
Von Pfaffen entered.  His humility was gone, and
the slight stoop of his shoulders had lifted into a
straight military line.  He went directly to the table
and began eagerly searching among the papers.
Once or twice he stopped, his head raised, alertly
listening, but the house was quiet and the General's
walk had carried him far into the garden.
</p>

<p>
The man turned the papers over and over.  Evidently
he failed to find what he sought.  His brows
bent in disappointment, but loath to give up easily,
he went on with the search.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the door opened again, and he turned
with a start to face Nanine.
</p>

<p>
"What are you jumping for?" she laughed, her
broad Breton face wrinkling curiously like one of her
native russet apples.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" he snarled, furious at being
interrupted.  "I thought you were gone."
</p>

<p>
"You did, did you?" she asked suspiciously.  "What
difference would it make to you?  I came back when
the young Colonel and his wife arrived, I'm needed."
</p>

<p>
"But you're not needed here," the man's voice was
shaking with impatience and anger.  He had borne
the insolence of this Breton peasant woman long
enough.  Nanine, however, was impervious to his
dislike.
</p>

<p>
"Madame wants you to take some tea and biscuits
to the Colonel's wife," she said stolidly, and Antoine,
with a scowl, turned back to the table.
</p>

<p>
There was so little time.  Through the window he
could see the red tip of the General's cigar moving
back and forth as his steps carried him nearer the
house.
</p>

<p>
"I can't go now, I'm busy," he said.
</p>

<p>
Nanine put her hands on her heavy hips and stood
facing him insolently.
</p>

<p>
"Is the General talking, or the butler?" she mocked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be impertinent," Antoine's brow darkened,
"it's your work!"
</p>

<p>
"My work!" sneered the old woman.  "It is my
work to clean up about the house.  What are you
bothering in here for anyway?" and her small eyes
narrowed suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
It did not suit Von Pfaffen's plans to have her
ill-will just now.  She must be cajoled.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he said more graciously, "if you take
up the tea and biscuits, I'll give you two francs."
</p>

<p>
"Two francs!  H'm!"  Nanine's scorn was unbounded.
</p>

<p>
"Five francs," he bargained.
</p>

<p>
Nanine looked at him out of the corner of her eye.
Five francs was five francs in these hard times.  It
might pay to be good-natured.
</p>

<p>
"Well then," she mumbled grudgingly.  "I'll do
it; five francs and a bottle of Burgundy for Jacques."
</p>

<p>
The man dived into his pocket hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"There's your money," he said thrusting it into
her hand.  "I'll get you the wine later.  Run along,
run along now, it is late," and he urged her toward
the door, his eyes on the window and the ever-nearing
red spark of the General's cigar.
</p>

<p>
Nanine shook his hand from her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be pushing me," she grumbled, "I'll go
fast enough," but Von Pfaffen fairly shoved her
through the door, and shutting it tightly after her,
hurried back to the table.
</p>

<p>
Once more, he searched among the maps and scattered
papers.  All these weeks spent here in this
menial position must not be wasted.  This paper was
the crowning point of his work, it must be found, but
the sound of the General's step on the terrace, sent
him to the fireplace, where, his shoulders once more
stooping in the meekness of the servant, he busied
himself with the dying embers.
</p>

<p>
As the General came through the window, he
glanced hastily from the man by the grate to the
scattered papers on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had gone to bed," he said sharply.
</p>

<p>
"No, Monsieur," answered the man, turning to him
mildly.  "I have been waiting to let the Colonel out,
I don't like leaving the doors unlatched these nights."
</p>

<p>
The man looked so humble, so harmless, as he rose
and faced him, the sagging lines of his thin face were
so pitiful, that the General was ashamed of his
suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose, Antoine," he said kindly, going over
to the table and beginning to gather the papers
together, "you regret not being at the front?"
</p>

<p>
The man's eyes sparkled a moment, as they rested
on the General's bent head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Monsieur," he said, with a meaning of his
own, "but in serving you, I am serving my country."
</p>

<p>
This was a sentiment the old soldier could appreciate.
How loyal all these men were, he thought.  It
was true, one could serve one's country in being of
service to those who could give their blood for her.
</p>

<p>
"It must be hard for a patriot like you," he said,
beginning to roll up his maps, "not to be engaged in
active service."
</p>

<p>
The man dropped his eyes discreetly.
</p>

<p>
"It is, Monsieur," he said quietly, "but at present
I can only watch and wait."
</p>

<p>
"Our cause must not fail, Antoine," said the General
as he fastened the straps of his map case, and
the man answered vehemently.
</p>

<p>
"That is what I have been saying to myself, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
The words had such an earnest ring to them, that
the General looked up curiously.
</p>

<p>
"You have been in the army, Antoine?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Monsieur, when I was younger.  I hope to
serve my country soon again."
</p>

<p>
The other sighed.  At the rate France was needing
men, age would soon be no barrier.
</p>

<p>
"The time may come before you expect, Antoine,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
The man's eyes sparkled again, and a curious smile
played about his thin lips.
</p>

<p>
"I am patiently awaiting that opportunity,
Monsieur," he replied.
</p>

<p>
The General looked at him with approval.
</p>

<p>
"I admire your patriotism, Antoine," he said, and
the man bent in his slight, servile bow, as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"I shall endeavor to live up to it, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
His master gathered the map cases and turned to
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said a little sadly, "France may need
you before the war is over."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen smiled ruefully.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not, Monsieur," he said, and then added
hastily, "that is&mdash;I trust it will not be necessary."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the General, turning to the door, "see
that the lights are down.  Good-night," and with the
map case carefully under his arm, he left the room.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen stood watching him go, his eyes fixed
covetously on the packet he carried.  Then he
shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and came
back to the table, but after another fruitless look, he
decided that what he was in search of was out of his
reach for the time being.  How to get it, that was
the problem, for get it he must.  For a moment he
stood thinking, then carefully locking the windows,
he turned out the lights and went slowly out of the
room.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
</h3>

<p>
Madame, all kindness and solicitude, showed Marie
to her room.  Everything she could, she did to make
the girl forget the sting of Paulette's words.  She
insisted upon her tasting the tea and biscuits which
old Nanine brought, although Marie could scarcely
swallow.  She helped her out of her dusty traveling
dress into a loose robe, and while Nanine brushed out
the long, golden hair and plaited it loosely for her,
Madame talked of the trip from Paris, asked regarding
their mutual friends, and spoke of their own
affairs.
</p>

<p>
Marie recognized and appreciated her kindness,
knowing that she was trying to give her an opportunity
to regain her composure, but she had to bite
her lips till they almost bled, to refrain from giving
way to her emotion.
</p>

<p>
When Nanine had tied the long plaits with ribbons
and hung up Marie's clothes, she took the almost
untouched tray and courtesied good-night.
</p>

<p>
After she had left, Madame kissed the girl tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep well, my daughter," she said, "we must help
one another in whatever may come."
</p>

<p>
Marie's eyes overflowed, and for a moment she
clung to the older woman desperately.
</p>

<p>
"Love me," she whispered, "I want you to love me
in spite of anything, and oh, please remember I have
never known a mother of my own!"
</p>

<p>
Madame soothed her.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome will be here in a moment, dear," she said.
"I must say good-night to my boy, too," and with a
parting kiss, she left her.
</p>

<p>
Marie stood a moment gazing about the large,
old-fashioned room&mdash;the great bed with its sombre
draperies of faded blue, the heavy black walnut dresser,
in the tall mirror of which the two candles, in their
silver sconces, reflected her own tear-stained face, the
small white stove with a vase of flowers standing on
its cold top, the long blue curtains which Nanine had
carefully pulled across the windows.  It was very
stately, but very cold, and Marie shivered as she
looked about her.
</p>

<p>
Gerome had brought her here among his own people
for protection, to insure her safety and comfort
when he was away.  But almost her first step across
the threshold, had brought her face to face with all
that was horrible in her past.  What a plaything
Fate had made of her, first to hold out so much that
was wonderful and beautiful, and then&mdash;suddenly it
came over her with sickening horror what it would
mean if this man, into whose eyes she had looked not
more than an hour ago, should tell what he knew.
</p>

<p>
She had thought herself so secure, the past had
seemed utterly obliterated, and here, on the very
brink of her shelter, that past had reared its hideous
head.  And now, when she had all the world to lose!
If he should tell!  If he should, even now, be talking
to Gerome or the General!  She almost screamed
aloud with the terror of it.
</p>

<p>
The horror and shock of finding herself face to
face with the man whom she thought had gone from
her life forever, convulsed her with fear so terrible,
as almost to deprive her of reason, but she must
think, or go mad.
</p>

<p>
Why was he here in the garb of a servant?  Would
it suit his purpose to expose her or to try to force
her back to him?  He was in disguise here.  He had
refrained from recognizing her before the others.
What could it all mean?  Had he failed to recognize
her because he feared to?  Was there some power she
might have over him now?  If so, how could she
use it?
</p>

<p>
The thought of facing him, of living under the
sane roof, was agony.  In her bag was a small bottle
of chloral which the doctor had given her to quiet her
nerves before she left Paris.  With shaking fingers,
she rummaged among her clothes to find it.  But
suddenly she threw the bag from her.  A quick flutter
at her heart called loudly her need to live.  With
the knowledge that she must go on, whatever came,
she paced the floor in an agony of suspense and
terror.
</p>

<p>
When Gerome knocked, she could scarcely answer,
her voice died in her throat.  Did he know?  Had he
guessed?  Had her terror shown itself too plainly in
her face?
</p>

<p>
He came in smiling, and as she looked at him, her
chin trembled like an unhappy child's.
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart," her husband took her in his arms,
"you must not mind Paulette."  So he thought it
was Paulette's words that hurt, he didn't know, oh,
the relief, the blessed relief.  She scarcely heard him,
as he explained.
</p>

<p>
"My little sister and Maurice love each other so
very much, she is really the dearest sister in the
world.  Be patient with her, for my sake."
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
"When you made me your wife," she said, "your
people became my people; your ways, my ways; your
country, my country!"
</p>

<p>
He held her close.
</p>

<p>
"We are truly one, are we not, <i>ma chérie</i>?" he
whispered.
</p>

<p>
Marie's answer was passionately earnest.
</p>

<p>
"Forever and ever!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
For a long time they were silent, content to be here
with one another, to know how much each meant to
the other.
</p>

<p>
Presently he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," he said, "I'll be back in the morning;
you're going to be a brave little woman, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
Marie turned away from him with a half sob.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Gerome," she stammered, "I&mdash;I need you&mdash;more
than ever!"
</p>

<p>
Something in her voice, in the flush on her cheek
as she turned from him, startled him.  He put his
hands on her shoulders and drew her face close to his.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"There's something&mdash;something I've been waiting
to tell you," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Gerome stared at her.  Her cheeks were glowing
with the flush that illumines the sky at dawn, and in
her deep blue eyes shone a light he had never seen
there before.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?" she asked, "can't you guess?"
</p>

<p>
And then, in a blinding flash, he understood.
</p>

<p>
For a long moment they stared into each other's
eyes, a happiness too great for words transfiguring
them.  The world that was bent on destroying itself,
did not exist for them.  It was as though God had
only just spoken the words, "let there be light!"  With
just such wonder and awe might the first man
have looked into the eyes of the first woman when
she had told him the miracle.
</p>

<p>
Tenderly, very tenderly, he drew her into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, my darling," he whispered, "is it true?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she breathed; then fearfully, "it does make
you happy?"
</p>

<p>
He led her to the couch and drew her down beside
him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, every one must be kind to you, so gentle
with you."
</p>

<p>
Marie hid her face against his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"You understand now why I dread to have you
leave me," she moaned.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
"But after to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;" and she began to weep
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Miserably, he sat and held her close.  That this
should come now, when he was going, perhaps to his
death.  Perhaps he should never even see this child of
his.  Well, if he must die, it would be in such a
manner that a son of his would remember with pride!
</p>

<p>
"When I knew what was to be," she said, staring
straight ahead of her, "I wanted you to take me to
your home, so that if you had to be away when
our baby came, I could still have the care and
protection of your family, but," and the memory of the
sinister face that had looked into hers, and all that
it meant, sent the blood from her lips, "I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome turned to her in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry you came here?" he asked.  "Have Paulette's
words&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, not Paulette," broke in Marie hastily.  "She
does not really mean to be unkind.  It is something
else!  I&mdash;I can't explain, but&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;I'm
afraid!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome drew her close to him and gently smoothed
her hair.
</p>

<p>
It was natural, he thought, for women to be frightened
at such a time, and Marie was so young, so
inexperienced.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bien aimée</i>," he whispered, "how happy we are
going to be.  Our lives are going to be so perfectly
attuned to one another, that between us there can be
nothing but harmony!"
</p>

<p>
She was sobbing afresh.
</p>

<p>
"But you are going away from me."
</p>

<p>
"Only for a few hours," he assured her, "and in
the meantime you will be with my mother and sister.
What harm can come to you here?"
</p>

<p>
But the girl was almost hysterical now, the strain
of that sudden meeting was beginning to tell.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she sobbed wildly, "you will love me
always?  Nothing can make you change?"
</p>

<p>
"Need you ask that, now?"
</p>

<p>
But she scarcely heard him.  She was thinking of
Von Pfaffen, and what she had run away from in
Vienna.  She was dreading the time when he would
tell, for that he would tell when it suited his purpose,
she never doubted, nor did she doubt that the knowledge
would take from her her husband's love.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Gerome," she sobbed, "if anything takes you
from me!  Your love is all I live for!"
</p>

<p>
Across the garden, sounded the chiming of a village
clock.  Gerome lifted her to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Kiss me, <i>ma chérie</i>" he said.  "I must go.  Nothing
can ever make me change.  Are you satisfied?"
</p>

<p>
Marie clung to him.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go to the gate with you.  I want to be
with you as long as I can," she begged, and with his
arm about her, Gerome led her down the stair.
</p>

<p>
The lights were burning dimly in the entrance hall,
and the house was quiet.  He slipped into his motor
coat and opened the hall door.  The moon was full
now and the garden lay peaceful and shining under
its light.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, my darling," he said as he stooped
and kissed her; "good-night, my boy's mother!"
</p>

<p>
Marie clung to him.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night," she whispered, "good-night, my
dearest!"
</p>

<p>
She stood on the step and watched him go, and
when the sound of the motor was no longer audible,
she closed the door and started up the stairs.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
</h3>

<p>
"Wait!"
</p>

<p>
Out of the shadows came the whispered command.
Marie staggered back against the wall with a stifled
scream as she turned and looked into the face of the
man she abhorred.  He had thrown off all semblance
of the servant and stood confronting her as she had
known him in Vienna.  In a swift vision, the months
she had spent with him flashed by her.  That night
in the little beer hall when she had gone home with
him; and that other night when he had laughed and
told her just how little she had meant in his scheme
of things.  Why had he followed her?  He had not
wanted her enough to keep her with him always.
</p>

<p>
To Von Pfaffen, the sight of her when she had
thrown back her veils, had been anything but
pleasant.  He had known for several days that the
General's son was bringing his wife to the château, but
he was not prepared for the overwhelming surprise
to find that it was Marie.  He saw at once that she
recognized him and his first fear had been that she
would betray him.  But the moment passed, and she
made no sign.  He realized instantly that it was fear
for herself that had kept her silent.  His knowledge
of the natural timidity of her nature, coupled with
the power he had over her, led him to think out a
plan that might put her presence here to his
advantage.  The deadly fear he saw in her face, as he
accosted her now, pleased him.  He knew that she
was his to do with as he liked.  She would prove a
useful pawn in the game he was playing.
</p>

<p>
He reached to the step where she stood and seized
her hand roughly.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," he whispered, "you will not betray me!"
</p>

<p>
Marie leaned away from him, looking into his eyes
with terror.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" she breathed.
</p>

<p>
"You need not ask that!  I'm here for my
country!" he said proudly.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of his words dawned upon her slowly.
So this was the interpretation of all those strange
papers she had been forbidden to touch in Vienna, his
secret journeys, his mysterious business!  He was a
spy!  Why hadn't she realized this and screamed it
out when she had faced him those few hours ago?
They would have taken him away before he had a
chance to tell; now it was too late.
</p>

<p>
He saw that she understood, and bowed coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "and you?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;" she faltered.  "I am a daughter of the
house!"
</p>

<p>
"You?" the contempt in his voice cut her like a
lash, and blindly, she started up the stair again, but
his fingers grasped her wrist.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!"
</p>

<p>
She turned and looked down at him where he stood
on the step below.
</p>

<p>
"Would you be so welcome if they knew, do you
think?" he sneered.
</p>

<p>
Marie cowered as though against a blow.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;you won't tell!" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen went on fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me," he said, "there is something I must
know, something for which I have taken their insolence,
their patronage," he spat out the words, "but
it is for the Fatherland!  Your country, and mine!
You must help me!"
</p>

<p>
The girl drew herself up proudly.
</p>

<p>
"My husband's country is my country," she said,
"his people are my people.  Let me pass!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen dropped her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," he said slowly.  "Then to-morrow I
will go to your husband's people, your people, and
tell them that the precious wife of their son and
brother&mdash;&mdash;" but the girl wheeled in terror:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," she said, "you won't do that, you can't!"
</p>

<p>
He smiled sardonically.
</p>

<p>
"I can and will," he said, "unless you do as I wish."
</p>

<p>
Marie turned toward him piteously.
</p>

<p>
"It&mdash;it would kill him," she pleaded.  "They will
disown me."  Her husband's kiss was still warm on
her lips.  Would he love her if he knew?  Could he?
</p>

<p>
The man watched her closely.  He knew he had
struck the right note.  Nothing must stand in the
way of his getting the information he sought.
</p>

<p>
"How proud they would be to welcome you as their
daughter if they knew!" he went on cruelly.
</p>

<p>
Marie shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"You won't tell them," she whispered, "you can't!"
</p>

<p>
His brilliant eyes narrowed.
</p>

<p>
"Will you do what I ask?" he bargained, and as
she looked into his face, the hard, cold face of the
fanatic who would sacrifice everything, including
himself, to gain his end, the girl knew that he held her
in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you want?" she murmured helplessly.
</p>

<p>
With a swift motion, he seized her wrist again and
brought his face close to hers.
</p>

<p>
"Remember," and he almost hissed the words, "if
you betray me, I'll give the proofs&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want!" she asked miserably, "tell
me, what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen drew her down and away from the
stair.  He looked about carefully, and then, sure that
they were secure from interruption he began:
</p>

<p>
"There is to be an important conference here
to-morrow," he said in quick, short tones, his voice
scarcely above a whisper, "the General and others.
They are to decide the time and place where an attack
is to be launched; this much I know.  You must get
me the name of the town&mdash;the time."
</p>

<p>
"I can't&mdash;I can't," broke in Marie, horror of what
he was asking her, searing her very soul.  "I can't
betray them, my husband's people!"
</p>

<p>
He tightened his fingers on her arm till the pain
was almost unendurable.
</p>

<p>
"Would they think twice about you if I told them
who you are?  What you are?" he sneered.
</p>

<p>
She stared into his eyes, her own wide with terror.
</p>

<p>
"It would mean their ruin," she gasped, "perhaps
death to my husband!  I can't!  I can't!"
</p>

<p>
"It means disgrace to you, and the death of his
love if you don't."
</p>

<p>
Marie broke away from his hold and buried her
face in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh God," she moaned, "and I thought the door
had been closed on that part of my life, forever."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen was impatient.
</p>

<p>
"Quick," he said, "decide!  We may be interrupted.
Will you?  Remember, I always keep my word.  If
you get this information, I promise in the name of
my government, no one shall know your share in it.
Will you?  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
Her slender shoulders shook with the sobs that were
breaking her.
</p>

<p>
"I can't!  I can't!"
</p>

<p>
Was she going to fail him after all?
</p>

<p>
"Remember," his voice was softer, "it is your
country asking this, your own country!"
</p>

<p>
"My country?"  Marie raised her head.  "This is
my country!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen looked at her with hatred in his eyes.
This weak little creature, was she going to be the
stumbling-block in the great work he was doing?
</p>

<p>
"Do you realize what it means if you refuse!" he
asked coldly.
</p>

<p>
She knew, alas! she knew only too well what it
would mean, not only to her, but to the little life she
carried under her heart, the little, new life, that God
himself had given into her keeping.  It might cost
that as well as the love of its father.
</p>

<p>
"Let me think," she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen was quick to see his advantage.
</p>

<p>
"Get your husband to tell you," he said eagerly.
"He will.  Write the name of the place and the time
where the attack is to be made, on a piece of paper.
Put it where I can get it!"
</p>

<p>
Marie looked about her wildly.
</p>

<p>
"Where, where?" she asked, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
The man's face was glowing with the success of his
plan.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find a place," he told her eagerly, "and a
way to let me know.  That is all.  I promise your
secret dies with me.  I am the only one who knows.
Young Franz was killed at the Marne.  There is no
one else."
</p>

<p>
Marie covered her face with her hands, but he drew
them away and made her look at him.
</p>

<p>
"I can trust you?" he said, his eyes narrow, his
thin mouth set and cruel, "you won't play me false?
If you do, remember, it is the end of your happiness
forever!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said dully.  "I know.  I'll&mdash;I'll do it!"
</p>

<p>
With a sigh of relief, the man dropped her hands,
and after a moment, she turned and went slowly up
the stair.  Her heart seemed dead in her bosom, her
eyes were dry and burning.  She clung to the balustrade
with the dizziness that threatened to engulf her.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen stood and watched her till she had
disappeared, then he turned out the lights and softly
left the hall, a smile of triumph on his lean, hard face.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
</h3>

<p>
The clock had chimed the hour, the half, and the
hour again, and still Marie lay tossing with mental
anguish under the heavy blue hangings of the great
bed.  What terrible thing had she promised to do?
Sell her husband's honor to this creature who had
taken her own.  She tried to look at every side of
the problem, to work out in her tortured brain just
what would happen if she defied Von Pfaffen.  She
knew he would not hesitate to go to the General and
brand her.  She knew he could do that without
incriminating himself.  He was diabolically clever.
She could see the kind look fade from the General's
eyes, the flush on Madame's cheek.  She could hear
Paulette justifying her suspicions of her, and
Gerome&mdash;she crushed her knuckles against her lips till her
teeth cut into them.
</p>

<p>
To see the lovelight die in his eyes, contempt taking
its place, to know that she would become an object
of loathing to him!  The thought was so terrible
that she smothered in the pillows the cry she could
not restrain.  She would rather see him dead, she
thought, and know that he had died loving her,
believing in her purity.
</p>

<p>
What was country, war, people, everything, compared
to just this one man who was life itself and
all that life could mean to her?  She couldn't give
him up.  She couldn't stand by and let his love and
faith in her be killed; she couldn't.  She tossed and
turned in an agony of despair.
</p>

<p>
Her imagination swept her on to the hour of her
destiny, to the time when Gerome's child should be
laid in her arms.  If it were a son, could she bear to
have him know the blot on his mother's life?  Suppose
it were a daughter, could she bequeath it this heritage
of shame?
</p>

<p>
She went over, day by day, her life in Vienna since
her father's death.  In the scorching light of
self-condemnation, she realized that she need not have
stayed with Von Pfaffen after that one dreadful
night.  She could have run away then, as she had
later.  She saw herself as the foolish, inexperienced
girl, tired of teaching stupid children, tired of
singing for music hall habitués, tired of scrimping in
order to live, glad of the haven and the companionship
of one of her own class.  She knew now that she
had not been wholly ignorant of Von Pfaffen's
intentions, or rather lack of intentions, toward herself,
that she had simply let the days glide by, blinding
herself to the situation and hoping against hope that
he would marry her.
</p>

<p>
She realized now that the story, if it had ended
after that first night in Von Pfaffen's apartment,
would not have been so beyond pardon.  But how
could she ever explain those long months with him?
She knew her husband's high standard of morals.  She
knew his intolerance of the thing that she had done.
She knew his pride in the ancient family name that
both he and his father had kept unsullied.  And now
what a blot on that honored escutcheon this would be!
</p>

<p>
"I can't bear it!" she sobbed.  "I can't bear it!"
</p>

<p>
Then Von Pfaffen's words echoed in her mind like
a siren's song.
</p>

<p>
"I promise in the name of my government, that no
one shall know of your share in this.  Your secret dies
with me!"
</p>

<p>
Why hadn't he been killed at the Marne instead of
Franz?  Why did he have to live on to come here and
torture her?  Her thoughts were distorted, feverish.
She saw herself an outcast, thrust into the streets,
jeered at by her husband's people, despised by
Gerome, her child taken from her, nothing left!
</p>

<p>
"God, oh, dear God," she moaned, "I can't let them
know, I can't!"
</p>

<p>
France was her country only by adoption.  The
people meant nothing to her, their aims, nor this
great struggle in which they were involved.  Her
own country meant little more.  Her world was
Gerome.  If he were killed in battle, she could die too,
and happily, if she knew that he had gone to his death
loving and trusting her.  But the thought that this
knowledge would turn him from her, would make him
curse her, living or dead, was too much for her to
bear.
</p>

<p>
She hated Von Pfaffen with the deadly hatred
of the woman whose betrayer uses his power over
her against the man she loves.  She was powerless in
his grasp.  She seemed to feel the steel bars of the
trap he had set for her, closing against her tender
flesh.  Through the darkness, she could see his brilliant
eyes, cold and cruel as they had looked into hers
to-night.  She knew she was helpless, she could only
pray that Fate might be kind, might find some avenue
of escape.
</p>

<p>
The down coverlet smothered her.  She tossed it
to the floor and slipping her bare feet onto the
polished boards, began noiselessly pacing up and
down the long room.  The moonlight came between
the heavy curtains and lay in a white streak on the
floor.  Back and forth, across this, she swung like a
prisoned tigress, her nails biting into the flesh of her
palms, the dry sobs catching in her throat.  She knew
that she would do what Von Pfaffen had insisted on
her doing.  She knew her courage was not great
enough to take the consequences if she did not, but
she loathed and hated herself, her very soul cried out
against what she was going to do, cried out, as it
beat against the bars her tormentor had forged for
her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, through the stillness, came a slight
sound, a faint rustling on the thick carpet of the
corridor outside her door.
</p>

<p>
She stopped her wild pacing to listen.  There it
was again.  Some one was astir, some one, whose
stealthy, furtive movements, plainly told of their wish
to be unheard.
</p>

<p>
She slipped into the loose robe Madame had left
with her, and softly opened the door.  Down the
corridor, a spot of light from an electric torch danced
uncertainly.  Presently it stopped at the door of the
General's bedroom, which was opened cautiously.  The
light was extinguished, and then silence.
</p>

<p>
Soundlessly she crept along the corridor toward
the door which had been left purposely ajar, and
through the crack, she could see the spot of light
fluttering about the room.  It rested for a moment on
the fine face of the old soldier lying peacefully asleep,
then shifted to the chair at the foot of the bed, over
which hung his coat.  A hand suddenly sprang out
of the darkness and groped through the pockets.  She
heard a faint rustle of paper and the light was
extinguished again.
</p>

<p>
She had only just time to slip back and flatten herself
against the wall, when a man came out and softly
closed the door after him.
</p>

<p>
She watched the light winking on and off, as he
went down the stair and across the hall, and then
noiselessly, she started to follow.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
</h3>

<p>
The great stairway took a wide turn at a sort of
landing about halfway down, from where the whole
length of the hall could be seen, as well as the rooms
opening upon the corridor above.  Here Marie paused
for a moment, and watched the light as it crossed the
hallway.
</p>

<p>
On the left, the double doors of the great dining-room
were slightly ajar, and through these it
disappeared, leaving the hall in darkness save for the
moonlight that came through the tall windows.
Without further thought, she hurried down the stair
and after the dark figure.  As she reached the
dining-room, the light had just disappeared through the
green baize swinging-door that led into the butler's
pantry, and holding her robe close about her, the girl
followed.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room looked very cold and vast in the
pale moonlight, the massive chairs and heavy carved
table sending black shadows along the polished floor.
From around the edges of the swinging-door came
a faint light.  Cautiously, she put her hand against
the panel and pushed the door open the merest trifle.
Through the crack she could see a man at the serving-table
which stood against the wall.  In the faint light
of a candle which he had evidently just lit, she
recognized Von Pfaffen.
</p>

<p>
In what fresh evil was he engaged?  What was it
he had taken from the General's room?  She might
be of use after all.  Apparently satisfied that he was
alone, he slipped a paper out of his pocket, and
spreading it on the table began making a tracing.
</p>

<p>
She could not see what this was.  She could only
distinguish its blue cover and that it appeared to be
some sort of a map.
</p>

<p>
He worked quickly, and with the ease born of long
experience.
</p>

<p>
Wondering, she watched as he rolled the thin tissue
paper copy he had made, in a tiny tube and thrust it
into what appeared to be a quill.  Then she saw him
stoop and pick up a basket from the floor.  Opening
the wicket, he took out a gray pigeon, which fluttered
for a moment in his hands.  Carefully, he fastened
the quill to its leg, his head bent low over the task.
</p>

<p>
She must see more.  Cautiously her hand pressed
the door, but the hinge creaked faintly under her
light touch, and at the sound he hastily thrust the
pigeon back into the basket, secured the wicket, and
blew out the candle.  Under cover of the darkness
the girl pushed the door wide.  This time the hinge
made no sound, and after a tense moment, Von
Pfaffen cautiously turned on his electric torch.  The
little stream of light struck full in her face.
</p>

<p>
"You!" he swore hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
He scowled at her.  He had thought her safely out
of the way for the night.
</p>

<p>
"My duty!" he said, between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
She took a step backward, but the man grasped her
by the arm, and drew her into the little room.  As the
green baize door swung shut after them, with a quick
movement, he latched it securely.
</p>

<p>
"You will be silent," he hissed.
</p>

<p>
She held away from him defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I were to call the General?"
</p>

<p>
"He would have me shot!" his voice was coldly
indifferent.  "But before I died, by God, I'd tell a story
that would send you into the streets to-night."
</p>

<p>
Marie gasped and he clutched her arm tighter.
</p>

<p>
"If you make a sound," he said, "I shall go to the
General now, and tell him what you are."
</p>

<p>
For a moment, she had a wild thought of running
swiftly back the way she had come, of awakening the
General, of facing the consequences.
</p>

<p>
"But if I give the alarm?" she asked, almost under
her breath.
</p>

<p>
He shot a quick look at her, sure of his quarry.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of that!  You would not dare!"
he said, looking at her evilly.
</p>

<p>
Marie subsided.  She could not.  He was right.
</p>

<p>
"Is&mdash;is it all so important?" she faltered.
</p>

<p>
Was the woman mad?  Couldn't she be made to
understand?
</p>

<p>
"Important?"  His voice was hoarsely eager.  "If
I get this safely over, it will mean thousands,
hundreds of thousands to me, it will mean the Cross, it
will mean glory to my country.  Why, the Fate of
France might depend upon it!"
</p>

<p>
Marie stared at him, wide-eyed.
</p>

<p>
"The Fate of France," she echoed.  The Fate of
France was Gerome's fate, was hers!  The Fate of
France!
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen held up the long blue envelope.
</p>

<p>
"This must be returned," he said; "no one must
suspect that it has been tampered with."  A plan was
forming itself in his mind.  It was the inspiration of
the moment, and his cruel nature gloated over it.  He
regarded her with a sardonic smile, as he relit the
candle.  "You have come upon me very opportunely,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
She did not hear him, she was staring into vacancy,
his phrase, the "Fate of France," echoing over and
over in her mind.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen drew her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot take this back," he said.  "If I were
discovered, I could not complete my work here.  You
must do it," his words cut across her brain clearly,
definitely.  She shrank away from him, terrified.
</p>

<p>
"I!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you," went on her tormentor, "at once.  He
sleeps soundly.  On a chair by his bed, hangs his coat.
You must slip this into the left inside pocket.  Do
this," there was a deep meaning in his voice, "and
we are both safe!"
</p>

<p>
"My God," she whispered, "I can't do it.  I, an
alien here, under their roof for the first night!  If
he waked and found me, what could I say to clear
myself?  I can't!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's eyes were almost hypnotic as they
glittered in the dim light.
</p>

<p>
"You will take the paper back!" he repeated
distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!"
</p>

<p>
"You must!" his face was very close to hers in the
little pool of yellow light.
</p>

<p>
She wrung her hands.  In her fancy, she seemed
like the gray pigeon she had seen fluttering in his
grasp.  She was just as helpless.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do?  What can I do?" she kept
repeating over and over.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen kept his eyes on hers.
</p>

<p>
"Do what I say," he answered; "and to-morrow,
after you have given me the information that will
cap this, I have sworn to you, and I shall keep my
word, I go out of your life forever!"
</p>

<p>
She was groping desperately in her mind for some
way out of it, something she could do to save the
"Fate of France."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen turned and went back to the table.
</p>

<p>
"I'll arrange this again carefully," he said, "no
one must suspect."
</p>

<p>
As he bent over his task, Marie's eyes fell on the
wicker basket in the shadow.  Through the bars,
protruded the edge of the little tube fastened to the
bird's leg.  She looked at it fascinated, a daring
possibility shaping itself in her mind.  The Fate of
France!  She glanced swiftly from the basket to the
man silhouetted against the light, her heart beating
wildly.
</p>

<p>
It was the work of an instant to insert her hand
in the basket, extract the tracing from the quill and
hide it in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
The next moment, he had finished his work, and
was examining it critically before the light.
</p>

<p>
"There," he said, as he turned to her again, "I
think now, even to the eyes of the old fox, it will seem
untampered with."
</p>

<p>
She held out a trembling hand.
</p>

<p>
"Give it to me," she cried hurriedly.  "Give it to
me."
</p>

<p>
"You have grown most anxious suddenly!"  Von
Pfaffen eyed her suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
The girl bit her lip.  She was in an agony of suspense
lest he should discover the absence of the tracing
before she could have time to return the original.
</p>

<p>
"I want to get it over with," she said desperately.
</p>

<p>
"If you play me false now," his face was terrifying,
"I swear that there will be nothing I won't do to make
you suffer!"
</p>

<p>
"Give me the paper," she begged.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen slipped it into his pocket with a
mocking smile.  He thought he understood her sudden
eagerness.
</p>

<p>
"It won't do to run any risk.  First my copy must
be off!"
</p>

<p>
"But every moment is precious," pleaded Marie,
fearful of discovery, "some one may waken."
</p>

<p>
The man stooped and picked up the basket.
</p>

<p>
"You are right," he agreed.  "Do you know what
this paper is?  It is the exact location of their
batteries.  Our aviators have searched and searched, but
they have masked them so damn well, we couldn't find
them.  But I've got it!"  In his triumph, his voice
rose and his eyes sparkled wildly.
</p>

<p>
Would he never have done?  She felt that her
nerves would snap under the strain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hurry, hurry," she breathed.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen went to the door and opened it softly.
She followed close at his heels as he went noiselessly
out through the long dining-room and across
the hall.  Carefully he opened the great door, and,
seizing her hand, led her out onto the terrace.
Then he opened the little wicket and lifted the cage
above his head.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they waited.  There was a faint
rustle.  The bird had sensed its freedom.  It stood
poised a moment at the opened cage door, then with
a swift whirr, it was out, soaring upward and away
through the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen, his square shoulders straight, his lean
face lifted to watch the flight, raised his hand in a
military salute.
</p>

<p>
"Take my greetings to the Fatherland," he cried
softly, and Marie, her hands pressed tightly against
her bosom, where the paper lay hidden, breathed a
prayer for France.
</p>

<p>
When the bird had disappeared, he turned and led
her back into the hall, softly closing the door after
them.
</p>

<p>
"Now your work," he said as he handed her the
blue envelope, "here is the paper.  Remember to put
it in the left inside pocket, and for God's sake, be
careful!"
</p>

<p>
She took it eagerly and started toward the stair.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen handed her the little torch.
</p>

<p>
"Take this," he said, and with the light held in her
hand, she went up the broad stair.
</p>

<p>
He stood below watching her until she disappeared
into the General's room.  After what seemed an age
to the man below, she came out again noiselessly and
closed the door after her.  Her bare feet made no
sound on the thick carpet.  Breathlessly, she leaned
against the railing.  Up through the darkness, came
Von Pfaffen's hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
"All right?"
</p>

<p>
Her answer floated down to him, "yes!"
</p>

<p>
With a muttered exclamation, he turned and left
the hall.  Quiet settled down once more over the house.
</p>

<p>
Marie crept softly into her own room, and lit one
of the tall candles.  Then she locked and barred the
door and stood motionless, listening, before the great
walnut dresser.  She fumbled in the bosom of her robe
and brought out the little tracing.  Her lips were
dry, her eyes dilated, her cheeks scorching.  Dimly in
the mirror she could see herself outlined partly by the
faint moonlight, partly by the flickering candle.
</p>

<p>
With a strangled sob, she held the paper to the
flame.  It coiled quickly into a tiny black ribbon and
lay a pinch of ashes in her hand, then she blew out the
candle and crept into the great bed under the shadow
of the heavy blue curtain.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
</h3>

<p>
Up and down, up and down, outside the long study
windows marched a sentry.  Outside the great gate
stood another.  Even the house door was guarded.
</p>

<p>
Angéle, her round arms bare, a great apron tied
about her, her feet in wooden sabots, was busy scrubbing
the kitchen floor of the gate house when the first
company arrived.  Soldiers were no new sight to the
girl by now, but so many here, what could it mean?
She dried her hands and clattered out to open the
gates.
</p>

<p>
"Keep them open, my girl," smiled the Captain.
"Others are coming," and leaving her standing round-eyed
and open-mouthed, he took his men and stationed
them about the place.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" she asked one of them.
</p>

<p>
The young soldier left to guard the gate, smiled
at her as he shouldered his gun and began pacing up
and down, but his Captain was still within ear-shot
and so he made no answer.
</p>

<p>
The girl turned and hurried back into the house.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma mère</i>," she called (Nanine was the only
mother she had ever known) "<i>ma mère</i>, war has come
even into the château."
</p>

<p>
"Eh," wheezed the old woman, coming heavily down
the stair.  "What are you saying?"  Angéle bade her
look out of the window.  By now, several automobiles
had arrived and were dislodging their passengers at
the great door, care-worn looking men for the most
part, grizzled of hair and mustache, their heavy army
coats dusty and mud-splashed.
</p>

<p>
Nanine put her head, in its broad Breton cap, out
of the door, only to find herself facing a sentry
standing there.
</p>

<p>
"Orders are to stay indoors this morning, <i>bonne
femme</i>," he said cheerily.
</p>

<p>
If anyone but a French soldier had dared to bar
her way, a storm would have broken about his head,
but to Nanine, the horizon blue of a <i>poilu's</i> uniform,
was never to be gainsaid in anything.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Eh bien, mon gosse</i>, if you say so, I'll stay in all
week!" she answered.
</p>

<p>
The man grinned and resumed his sentry-go.
</p>

<p>
The purring motors brought Marie to her window.
She had tossed and turned through the dark hours,
dreading the task that was before her.  Her mind
whirled trying to plan a way that might satisfy Von
Pfaffen and yet not betray her husband's cause.  But
like a wild bird, she beat against her prison bars,
knowing there was no way out.
</p>

<p>
As she parted the curtains and looked out on the
driveway, Gerome was just stepping from a motor
car.  There were three other officers with him, a tall
thin man with a long nose and a heavy gray mustache,
and a fat, red-faced man who wore a general's
stars.  The third, she could not see, his face was so
muffled in his coat collar, although the day, early as
it was, was quite warm.  Another motor, whose
occupants had evidently already entered the house, was
just turning from the door.
</p>

<p>
She pushed the curtains back and stood looking out
into the sunshine.  How peaceful everything looked,
and yet in the room below her, men were planning
the best way to surprise and kill thousands of their
fellow men, and here was she, her brain whirling,
trying to devise a means to discover how they were to
accomplish it.
</p>

<p>
She slipped quickly into her clothes and sat down
again by the window to wait until the conference
should be over.  She knew that Gerome would come
to her then.  Every nerve was strained with a
harrowing expectancy.  It was as though she awaited
her execution.
</p>

<p>
The little gilt clock on her dressing-table, cheerily
ticked out the minutes as though they had been filled
with joy, instead of agony.  The sun sparkled and
glittered on the dew-wet leaves as brilliantly as
though the whole world on which it shone was as
peaceful as the château garden.  A robin was fluting
happily.  But up and down, before the door and before
the great gate, paced the sentries, and from the
distant horizon came the ever-present rumbling of
the guns.
</p>

<p>
She sat staring at the thin lace curtains fluttering
gently in the breeze, under the faded blue ones.  What
was the day to bring her, she wondered?
</p>

<p>
There was a gentle knock at the door.  She turned
with a start.  In answer to her faint, "<i>Entrez</i>,"
Madame came in.
</p>

<p>
"You are awake, dear?" she said gently.  "I came
to see.  The General is having a very important
meeting in his study and has asked me not to have the
servants come into the house.  Will you mind waiting
for your breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
Marie had risen to greet her.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she said hastily, "I don't think I shall
want anything to eat," and her hands trembled at
her throat.
</p>

<p>
Madame led her back to the chair and made her
sit down.
</p>

<p>
"We must all be brave," she said gently.
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, they could hear the door of the
General's study opening and a murmur of men's voices.
</p>

<p>
Madame listened attentively for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"The conference is over," she said, "pray God what
they have decided may be successful."
</p>

<p>
Marie turned miserably back to the window.  The
time for her task was drawing nearer.  There might
be some way out of it.  There must be.
</p>

<p>
"I'll order coffee now," said Madame.  "Try to be
calm, dear, we women live in a man's world," and
with a sigh, she left her.
</p>

<p>
Marie watched the officers come out and get into
their motors.  She watched the General standing tall
and straight in the sunshine, as he shook hands with
his <i>confrères</i>.  Gerome's voice came up to her, as he
told his father he would go as far as the village with
them, and then come back, and she knew it meant he
was coming back to her.
</p>

<p>
She watched the motors go down the driveway and
out of the great gates.  The General saluted the last
man as he left, and then turned back into the house.
The little band of soldiers mustered under their
Captain and started after the chugging cars.  Angéle
pushed the heavy gates closed after them and clattered
back to her scrubbing, and as the sound of the
motors died away in the distance, Marie fell on her
knees by the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh God," she prayed, "help me!  Help me!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
</h3>

<p>
As the General strode back across the hall, Madame
came down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in?" she asked.  "Is the conference
over?"
</p>

<p>
He looked up at her seriously.
</p>

<p>
"I have just bade them good-bye, Cecile; we have
had an anxious morning, but please God, it will result
in victory for France."
</p>

<p>
Madame smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all I am to hear, my husband?"
</p>

<p>
"A soldier's wife must not ask," he said, "what
there is for her to know is told without a question."
</p>

<p>
"And I am content that you know best," she said,
looking at him tenderly.
</p>

<p>
He put his hands on her shoulders.  For a moment
they stood looking into each other's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting to say good-bye to Gerome," she
said at last.
</p>

<p>
Her voice was calm and even, her clear eyes looked
into his bravely, unflinchingly.  These two had lived
together so long that the spoken word was unnecessary
to convey their thoughts to one another.  The
absence of demonstration in sorrow is often its best
indication of sincerity, and although her proud face
gave no sign, he knew the struggle that was going
on in her breast.  He knew that she lived only for
this son of theirs, a son who was worthy of the pride
they felt in him.  And to-day, he was to march away
to take his place in that Armageddon from which so
few returned, or returned in such a manner as to
mock the splendid manhood that had been theirs.
</p>

<p>
"Cecile," he said, "I understand!  We can only
hope!  He is one of the army, and the army is France!
If he does not come back to us, then he will have died
the noblest death that can come to a man!  He will
have given his life for his country!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled bravely.
</p>

<p>
"And when their country has needed them," she
said, "the women of France have never been called
upon in vain."
</p>

<p>
Her husband looked at her, the fine lift of her
stately head, the calm poise of her clear eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You are the spirit of France itself," he said;
"women like you have been the inspiration in every
crisis in our history!"
</p>

<p>
Madame sighed.  This beautiful life of theirs, these
years of happiness together, how could she even think
of so bitter an ending as war must bring.  But he
must not be disappointed in her.  She must be what
he thought her, the spirit of France itself.
</p>

<p>
"I am so concerned about Marie," she said, after a
moment; "do you think the government will take any
action because of her being an alien?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," he said, "they were married before the
war.  She has lived in Paris now over a year, there
is no cause for anxiety."
</p>

<p>
The girl's sad face was still vividly in her
mother-in-law's memory.
</p>

<p>
"Still," she said, "I'm glad Gerome brought her
here, it lessens the chance of her being embarrassed
by prying officials."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," he said, "we won't criticise the government
for taking every precaution at a time like this."
</p>

<p>
Madame looked up the stairs toward Marie's room.
With a woman's intuition, she had sensed something
of the struggle going on in the girl's soul; with the
eyes of a mother she had laid the cause at one door.
</p>

<p>
"There must be many marriages such as this," she
said, "and how sad it is for all concerned, for although
their loyalty may be unquestioned, in the minds of
some there may lurk a doubt."
</p>

<p>
"And yet," he said, "if there had been more of
these international marriages, this war might never
have occurred!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled faintly.  She was accustomed to these
Utopian theories.  She had heard him work out to his
own satisfaction all the problems of humanity,
wondering at a blundering world for not finding the
solutions that were so simple to him, but this was a new
subject.
</p>

<p>
"Universal peace would be the most precious gift
God could bestow on his people," she said.  "How will
these international marriages help to bring it about?
War not only tears husband and wife apart by death,
but by allegiance to different causes.  How could that
be overcome?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her seriously.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that our sons and daughters should seek
their proper mates from environments far removed
from one another.  In that way, the best of civilization
would be evenly distributed.  The best blood, the
best intellect, the best culture.  Then no one country
could believe itself to have a monopoly.  There would
be one universal language, mutual interest, new blood
would be infused into decadent veins, new vigor,
strength, mental and physical.  Political boundaries
would be meaningless, political differences would be
impossible, and the sword would be sheathed forever!"
</p>

<p>
"This is a strange philosophy for a soldier," she
said smilingly, "one whose profession is arms!"
</p>

<p>
"The soldier is the nation's surgeon," he said; "he
tries to cut away the evils that menace its existence,
and he most of all is glad when his work is finished.
He seldom feels the hatred and rancor that is so common
to the civilian who fights his battles over a dinner
table."
</p>

<p>
Together they walked to the window.  Up and
down the drive the tire marks of the recent motors
crossed and recrossed.  Low down on the distant
horizon hung the dark form of an observation balloon.
And dull, reverberating, incessant, muttered the guns.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh the General turned from the window.
</p>

<p>
"Come, my dear," he said, "there are some
important papers to go over before I leave!"

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
</h3>

<p>
When Von Pfaffen came into the salon, the curtains
were still drawn across the windows, the chairs
still awry, and on the little escritoire papers lay
scattered about as they had been left the night before.
</p>

<p>
Madame had obeyed the General's orders literally,
and the servants had been excluded from the house
while the conference was going on.
</p>

<p>
He pushed back the heavy curtains and opened
the windows.  His shoulders squared as he filled his
lungs with the crisp morning air.  His cloak of
humility was completely cast aside, but at a step in
the hall, he turned quickly, again the servant.
</p>

<p>
Marie opened the door softly.  As she saw him, her
face blanched.  She stepped back, but the man
stopped her.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door," he said peremptorily, and scarcely
conscious of what she did, the girl obeyed him.
</p>

<p>
He came close to her, his lean face eagerly alight.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "any news?"
</p>

<p>
"None!" Marie shrank away from him.  "I haven't
seen my husband yet."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's lips pulled back across his teeth in
an oath, and the girl looked up at him piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Why couldn't you do it?" she pleaded.  "It's your
work, and honorable, I suppose, for you."
</p>

<p>
He turned on her fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"How could I?" he snarled, "with a guard at every
door."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked into his cold eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Have you no mercy?  Was not last night enough
to ask of me?"  Her memory went back again to
those dreadful moments at the General's bedside.
"Once I thought he was awake," she whispered, "his
eyes staring straight at me.  It was all I could do to
prevent myself from shrieking aloud."
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's jaw set, a little muscle in his cheek
worked nervously.
</p>

<p>
"You're not going to fail me now?  You haven't
let him go without getting me that information?"
</p>

<p>
Marie shuddered under the hatred in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she said hastily, "he has only gone as far
as the village with the other officers.  He'll be back
to say good-bye to me," and then she added
piteously, "Must I?  Must I?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no other way!"  Von Pfaffen clutched
her wrist in a grip of iron.  "He must not leave
before you know," he said almost against her face; "do
you hear?  If he does, and this information which
means so much to our country&mdash;yes," as she tried to
pull away, "yours as well as mine&mdash;if this information
slips away from me, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She struggled in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please, please!" she pleaded, but he went on
brutally:
</p>

<p>
"I'll fling your shame in every face I meet.  I'll
brand you as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Please!  Please!"
</p>

<p>
He flung her hand away from him.
</p>

<p>
"See then that you do as I tell you, and I give you
my word you are safe, otherwise&mdash;&mdash;"  There was a
step on the gravel outside.  "Hush," he whispered,
"here he comes," and as Gerome stepped through the
window, Von Pfaffen relapsed once more into the
manner of a servant.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Monsieur," he said softly.
</p>

<p>
Gerome smiled into his wife's white face.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning," he said.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen turned to Marie, his shoulders stooping
with the meekness of Antoine, his eyes blazing
with the threat he held for her if she failed him.
</p>

<p>
"Anything more, Madame?" he asked softly.
</p>

<p>
She was breathless.  Why didn't he go, why
couldn't he leave her alone?
</p>

<p>
"No," she said desperately, "only go!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madame," adding with deep significance,
"I am serving luncheon in the garden to-day," and he
turned and left the room, but even while she looked
up into her husband's wondering face, she knew that
Von Pfaffen would be going back and forth just outside
the windows, as he laid the table, going back and
forth much as the sentry had done earlier in the
morning, watching every move she made, everything she
did.  She was trapped.  Her Judas-hour had come!
</p>

<p>
Gerome put his arm about her shoulders and lifted
her lips to his.
</p>

<p>
"My dear," he said, "why this impatience?  Poor
Antoine, what must he have thought?"
</p>

<p>
She hid her face against his arm, her shoulders
quivering.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she sobbed, "I don't care, I only
know that you are going to-day&mdash;this morning&mdash;oh
God, am I ever going to see you again?"
</p>

<p>
Gerome held her close.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he murmured, "it is for you and for our
beloved country!"
</p>

<p>
She clung to him.  Oh, to have him with her
always, to be away from everything and everybody,
just they two.  Why hadn't some power told her that
somewhere this man was waiting for her, so that she
might have come to him as pure as he thought her?
</p>

<p>
"You're all I have," she cried, "what is France,
people, armies, the whole world, compared to you?"
</p>

<p>
His heart was bleeding too, with the tragedy of
having to leave her now, of all times, but he must not
let her see.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest," he said unsteadily, "are you a soldier's
wife, and send him into battle this way?  Are
you going to let me go remembering only your
tears?"
</p>

<p>
"I love you, I love you!"  Her very soul was shaking
with her grief; "you're all I have."  He held her
away from him and tried to force her to look into
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Let me feel that you are sending me to fight for
France and you," he pleaded, "with a smile on your
lips, pride in your heart, because of the honor done
me!"
</p>

<p>
Marie looked at him, all the love she had to give
in her eyes.  The pride he asked for was in her heart,
the smile struggled to her lips, then through the
window she caught sight of Von Pfaffen.  He was too far
off to hear what they were saying, but his eyes held
hers meaningly.
</p>

<p>
The smile faded, leaving her face set and tragic.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" she began desperately,
"where are you going?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"That," he said seriously, "I may not tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I must know, I must know!"  Von Pfaffen was
watching her.  She must go on.  The tide was too
strong, it swept her on relentlessly.  "I must know!"
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he said, pressing his cheek against her
hair, "Don't you know you're asking something that
I must guard with my honor?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment she sobbed aloud against his
shoulder.  Even with her eyes hidden, she knew that
Von Pfaffen was standing just beyond in the garden,
meekly laying the table for luncheon, but ready to
throw aside the humility of the servant and stand
before her, her accuser.  She must go on.
</p>

<p>
"Then it's true," she sobbed, "it's true, what I've
been fearing, what I've been dreading.  There is to
be a terrible battle somewhere, soon.  I won't know
where."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, <i>ma chérie</i>," soothed Gerome, but she
sobbed on.
</p>

<p>
"I must know!  I must know!"
</p>

<p>
"Marie," it was almost more than he could bear.
The agony of her grief frightened him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you love me enough to tell me?" she
pleaded.  "I must know!  You may be wounded, you
may be killed!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome's endurance was almost worn away.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Marie&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but she shook her
head.
</p>

<p>
"I must know," she begged, "you don't know what
it means to me!"
</p>

<p>
Her sobs were so wild, her form shook so with their
force, the man's will broke.
</p>

<p>
"Darling," he whispered passionately, "I can't bear
this!  Please&mdash;please&mdash;if I tell you, will you promise
to be brave?"
</p>

<p>
Marie sprang away from him.
</p>

<p>
The consciousness of the awful thing she was doing
overwhelmed her like a deluge.  Now that the
information she wanted was trembling on her husband's
lips, her soul cried aloud to stop it, to prevent his
telling before it was too late.
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me," she cried, "don't tell me," but he
crushed her close to him.
</p>

<p>
"Will you remember," he said tenderly, "that it is
not only my honor that I am giving into your
keeping, but my country's safety?"
</p>

<p>
He must not tell her, she would not listen.  She
cowered in his arms, but Gerome went on.  It was
too late.
</p>

<p>
"My loved one, listen," he whispered, "I want you
to pray as you have never prayed before, that
to-morrow, at dawn, before the forts of Draise, God
will grant our beloved country victory!"
</p>

<p>
Marie sank into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," she breathed, "Draise&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at dawn!"
</p>

<p>
She had nerved herself for the ordeal and it had
come.  A cold wave passed over her, she felt her
expression alter, her features set.  She seemed to hang
in a great void, all the natural forces of her nature
for the moment were suspended.  And then she was
looking into his eyes again.  As from a great
distance, she heard his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, what is it?  Don't look at me like that!
I am only one of the millions and for every man who
goes there is a woman who mourns.  It is hard for
you, I know, terribly hard, yet they endure, and so
must you.  In a great struggle like this, the
individual is lost.  He is only a stone in the rampart
erected against tyranny.  We do not serve our own
ends, but we are united for a cause that means more
to all of us than life or any personal sacrifice that
man can make!  I would be unworthy of your love if
I were not willing to do my duty for my country at
no matter what cost to me, and I know that you would
do likewise."
</p>

<p>
His arms were about her, his face close to hers,
there was a light in his eyes that she had never seen
there before.
</p>

<p>
A veil that had obscured her clear vision was torn
away.  For the first time she understood how false,
how wrong had been the structure on which she had
built.  Real sacrifice meant denying oneself so that
ideals much greater than can have to do with individual
affairs might be served.  A country's cause,
the saving or the loss of which would make millions
happy or miserable, that is what she was about to
jeopardize!  In her weakness and miserable selfishness
she had almost been tempted to do a dreadful
deed.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she shuddered, then she lifted her
face to his.  The light in his eyes flooded into hers,
sank into her heart, transfigured her.  Gerome, looking
at her, saw a miracle come to pass, for the weak,
trembling creature, quaking with terror who had
crept into his arms with the kiss of betrayal upon her
lips, had passed away leaving a radiant-faced,
glowing-eyed, courageous woman.
</p>

<p>
She had the information that would assure her
safety, yet she knew that no matter what the
consequences to her, she would never use it.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," she said, and her voice was clear
and firm, "my gift to your country is the most
precious thing I have, and I give it proudly!"
</p>

<p>
There was a tense silence, too sacred for words.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," he said at last, unsteadily; "kiss me
again!"
</p>

<p>
She lifted her lips to his in a long kiss, wildly,
passionately, a kiss that might be their last in this
world, but that to her meant the sacred seal of his
faith in her.
</p>

<p>
Then he tore himself away.  As long as she could
see him from the window, her eyes held their new
light of exaltation, but when the gates had closed
after him, she sank huddled into a chair, weeping
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Presently she raised her head.  Von Pfaffen stood
in the garden watching.  His sinister stare had
penetrated her consciousness and brought her back to a
realization of what lay before her.
</p>

<p>
With an effort she calmed herself.  It was necessary
for her to think, to plan.  In a few moments he
would come for the information.  What was she to
tell him?  There was no doubt that he knew she had
obtained it.  Would she defy him?  Tell him to do his
worst and take the consequences?  Would she expose
him to the General, give him up to arrest, and so
make it impossible for him to do further harm?  Or
was there a better way?
</p>

<p>
In the whirling tangle of her thoughts a plan was
shaping itself.  Vague, formless as yet, but a plan
the daring of which set her heart throbbing with the
magnitude of its possibilities.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's words echoed and re-echoed in her brain.
</p>

<p>
"Draise&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at dawn!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's instructions had been&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Write the name of the town and the time on a
slip of paper."
</p>

<p>
Suppose she should substitute the name of some
other town for the one which her husband had told
her, a place far removed from the point where the
attack would actually be made?
</p>

<p>
If the enemy could be given the wrong information
and act upon it, would it not mean that he
would turn his forces away from the point where the
battle was to be fought and so assure victory for
the French?
</p>

<p>
This man had taken advantage of her inexperience
and had wrought evil and unhappiness in her life in
the guise of a friend.  He was so sure of his power
over her, that he was trying to use her as an
instrument against her husband and the cause for which
at this moment he might be giving his life.  Surely
she was justified in bringing confusion to his plans
which were directed against herself and those who
were dear to her.
</p>

<p>
To outwit him!  To make his efforts to crush her
be the means of his own undoing.  To prove to him
that the wife of Gerome, developed and strengthened
in the atmosphere of love with which she had been
surrounded, was a different woman from the weak,
inexperienced Marie of Vienna.
</p>

<p>
Her gentle heart had never known the desire for
revenge, but as her mind reviewed all that she had
suffered at the hands of Von Pfaffen, she felt for the
first time the flame of bitter hatred.  She would crush
him as he had thought to crush her.  She would give
him information, but of such a nature as to ruin his
career, defeat the plans of the cause he served.
</p>

<p>
But what place should she substitute for the right
one?  She had often heard her little maid in Paris
speak of Sains, the town where she was born.  She
knew it was near the frontier, though some distance
from Draise.  Why not write Sains instead of Draise?
</p>

<p>
She well knew the nature of the man with whom
she was dealing.  He would never rest until he had
been revenged upon her.  She scarcely dared think
what it would mean to her when her husband and his
family knew everything.  But Gerome had spoken of
sacrifice.  This would be hers for the cause he loved.
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks flushed, her eyes were brilliant.  She
hurried to the little escritoire and wrote hastily on
a slip of paper:
</p>

<p>
"Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak."
</p>

<p>
As she finished Von Pfaffen entered from the
garden.  He came toward her, an eager gleam in his
eyes, but before he could speak the door opened and
Paulette entered.
</p>

<p>
"Antoine," she said, "father wishes to see you in
the library."
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mademoiselle," he answered curtly, but as
he made no move to go, Paulette, surprised, repeated:
</p>

<p>
"At once, do you hear?  He is waiting!"
</p>

<p>
Again he answered, his face purple with suppressed
rage:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mademoiselle," and with almost a military
turn, he left the room.
</p>

<p>
Marie waited, breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
Paulette noticed her agitation and attributed it
to her rudeness of the night before.  She came over
to her sister-in-law contritely.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," she began, "I was unkind yesterday.
Forgive me, I can feel for you.  I know what you are
suffering."
</p>

<p>
Marie's fear was that the little paper on the desk
might fail to serve its purpose, that something might
occur to warn Von Pfaffen.  She knew that he would
leave as soon as he got possession of it.  She was in
an agony of apprehension lest this interruption now,
when every moment was precious, might in some way
thwart her plan.
</p>

<p>
But Paulette saw only in her distress sorrow at
Gerome's going.  Her heart, naturally kind, warped
though it was for the time by the bitter hatred for
the enemies of the man she loved, sympathized with
her alien sister-in-law.  Love she could understand.
She must do what she could to help her.  Her mother
had been right.
</p>

<p>
"Let us be friends," she said.  "Gerome wishes it.
Let us comfort one another."
</p>

<p>
Marie stared at her blindly.  Could she tell this
girl?  Would she have done the same thing?  Her
eyes looked far away.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," she said at last, "there is nothing worth
while but the love of the one you care for, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"That and his honor," answered the girl.
</p>

<p>
"His honor!" repeated Marie.  Thank God she had
not betrayed his honor.  She took her sister-in-law's
hands in hers.  Perhaps after all her plan had not
been the right one.  Perhaps this girl could tell her
a better way.  "Suppose you had to choose, and you
could save only one thing," she said, "Maurice's
honor, or his love for you, which would it be?"
</p>

<p>
Paulette looked at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," she said, "that could not be
possible.  We can all only pray that they come back
to us."
</p>

<p>
Marie turned away with a catch in her throat.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," she said, "if you only understood!"
</p>

<p>
The girl put her arm about her waist.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said soothingly, "let me take you to
your room.  We can be more quiet there."
</p>

<p>
With all her heart Marie prayed that the sacrifice
she was making might not be in vain, that it would in
some small measure make amends for what she had
done in the past.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh she let Paulette lead her away.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
</h3>

<p>
Madame coming in later, found the room still
disordered, and as she rang the bell, she shook her head
over the interrupted routine of the household.  Even
with all the serious problems before them, the little
every-day things must not be neglected.
</p>

<p>
"Nanine," she said, when the old woman answered
her ring, "the General's friends are gone, and you
can put the room in order now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madame," the old woman looked about her,
grumbling.  Long before this hour the work of the
household was usually finished.
</p>

<p>
"The little desk also, Nanine," Madame reminded
her as she was leaving the room; "gather up all those
waste papers and burn them," and she closed the door
after her.
</p>

<p>
The old woman went about heavily, pulling the
chairs in place and arranging the disordered table.
Then she went to the desk and swept into her broad
apron the loose papers.  With them went the little
note Marie had left for Von Pfaffen, the slip of paper
that was to sacrifice her happiness for the sake of
France.
</p>

<p>
But Nanine only grumbled at this extra work.
This was what Antoine should do.  Where was he?
Why wasn't he here?  She shuffled to the fireplace
and emptied her apron into the grate.  Stooping
stiffly she struck a match and lit the little pile of
papers.  As they blazed up, she rested back on her
heels, her shriveled old hands held out to the tiny
blaze, grateful for the warmth on this crisp morning.
</p>

<p>
She didn't hear the door open, nor see the dusty,
hard-ridden young soldier who entered.  Her faded
old eyes stared into the flames, tearless, but full of
the hopeless tragedy of the peasant who gives all and
must never ask why.
</p>

<p>
"Mother!" and at the word she turned with a
start.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques!" she cried, scrambling to her feet.
"Back so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"The message from Captain le Cerf was received
at Headquarters," he told her as he kissed her, "and
I was ordered to bring it here at once."
</p>

<p>
Even in her joy at seeing this dearly loved son the
old woman's heart was glad for Paulette.
</p>

<p>
"So he got away?" she said; "won't my little
Mam'selle be happy?  When is he expected?"
</p>

<p>
Jacques stretched his dusty length in Madame's
damask-covered chair, and his mother did not
reprimand him.  Nothing was too good for him.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be at Sains," he said, "to-morrow, at
daybreak!"
</p>

<p>
"At Sains?" she said, "why, that's not far!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques held up a note.
</p>

<p>
"He arrives to-morrow at daybreak," he said; "it's
written here."
</p>

<p>
She came to his side with her head as close to his
as the great wings of her Breton cap would allow,
and peered at the paper the boy held out to her.
</p>

<p>
"'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak," she read
slowly, her broad forefinger tracing out the words.
</p>

<p>
She laid the note down on the desk, almost on the
same spot where not many minutes before had rested
Marie's hasty scrawl.
</p>

<p>
"Do you have to go back at once?" she asked
wistfully.
</p>

<p>
The boy patted her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother," he said; "there is great work to
do, and I must get back and do my share!"
</p>

<p>
"But," and her voice shook, "when will I see you
again?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, mother," he said, "I can't tell!"
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly the tears started from her faded
eyes and trickled down the furrows of her rough
checks.
</p>

<p>
"You will be careful?" she asked huskily; "you're
all I have now, I'm&mdash;I'm getting a bit old
and&mdash;you're all I have," she finished weakly.
</p>

<p>
Jacques patted her shoulder roughly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry, mother," he grinned, sheepishly
conscious of the tears in his own eyes, "don't worry,
I'll come back!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman clung to him fiercely, her chin
quivering, her faded eyes blazing with the fire that
outlasts all others.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you have to go?" she cried hoarsely,
"what have we ever done?  Why should you kill
anyone?  Why should anyone kill you?  Why?  What's
it all for?  What's it all about?"  Her withered
cheeks were wet, her staunch old heart was torn with
a sort of bewildered sorrow.  "Why should my other
two boys be taken from me?" she went on.  "Pierre,
the finest smith in Brittany!  Jean, who could lift
an ox off its feet!  I don't understand!"
</p>

<p>
The last of her brood shook his sturdy head.  He,
too, had asked himself "why?"  He had heard others
about him asking why, and to none had there been
given an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand myself, mother," he said; "but
the country says we must go, and so we go!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman's anger flared up again.
</p>

<p>
"The ones who should suffer are those who set
them on," she cried; "but they never do!  They never
do!  It is only we mothers of strong young men.  I
don't see why!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques looked at her gravely.  "It is for our
country," he said; "they want to invade it, destroy
our homes, our fine old buildings.  We can't let them
do that," and he squared his shoulders as his country
was doing.  "We'll go on fighting till they stop
trying!" he said.
</p>

<p>
Nanine dried her eyes on her apron.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you're right, Jacques," she sighed,
"but I've given two."
</p>

<p>
"The officers say it will be over soon!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, "they've said that for a long
time, but it goes on, and men are being ground up
like&mdash;like coffee in a mill!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Not me, mother," he assured her.
</p>

<p>
"How do I know?" her heavy lips were quivering
pathetically again; "when you were a prisoner I
thought you were safe till it was all over.  I thought
I'd saved one out of the three!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques sighed.  He never remembered seeing his
mother break before.  When the news had come about
Jean, she had sat wide-eyed and silent for an hour,
and then had risen and gone about her usual tasks
without mentioning his death.  Pierre had lain
wounded for days at Neuilly.  She had made the long
trip to see him and the finest smith in Brittany had
gasped away his life in the arms that had first held
him.  She had journeyed back to the little gate-house
of the Château de la Motte, dry-eyed and silent.
But to-day, now that this last one of her brood was
leaving her perhaps forever, the strong old heart
could no longer bear its burden of grief.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come back, mother," he said huskily, "I'll
come back a&mdash;a&mdash;sergeant."
</p>

<p>
"Much good that'll do without arms or legs," she
grunted.  "I've seen a lot like that!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques laughed uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"But not me, mother!"
</p>

<p>
"I was proud to think that you got away from
them," she went on, "that they couldn't hold you, but
I almost wish you were back."
</p>

<p>
Jacques looked at her heaving shoulders and tragic,
withered face.
</p>

<p>
"When Pierre and Jean went, you didn't take on
so."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know what it was like then," she choked,
"I didn't know what it was like!"
</p>

<p>
"I must go now, mother," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
The old woman tried bravely to smile into the
young face.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you stay and have something to eat?" she
begged.
</p>

<p>
Jacques was hungry, very hungry.  His soul
yearned for the many good things his mother cooked.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could," he said wistfully, "but it's orders."
</p>

<p>
Nanine threw her arms about his neck and rocked
him back and forth.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful," she pleaded, "you're all I have.  God
bless you!"
</p>

<p>
The boy tore himself away.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, mother; be sure and give the note to
Mam'selle," he called as he went through the long
window into the garden.  Nanine waved him a tearful
good-bye, her apron held to her lips, her heart in
her eyes.  She watched him till he was out of sight.
</p>

<p>
What a bitter lot is woman's.  The world belongs
to men.  For women it is only a meeting, a parting,
a supreme joy for awhile, and then endless, hopeless
tears.  With a groan she turned heavily back into
the room.
</p>

<p>
The note for her Mademoiselle must not be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
As she turned to the desk where it lay, Von Pfaffen
came in.  His face darkened.
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said roughly, "what are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
Nanine eyed him resentfully, her heavy Breton
face flushing.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you to order me about?" she asked, in
her coarsest peasant manner.
</p>

<p>
The man was furious at her insolence.
</p>

<p>
"You'll go out of here," he said, between his teeth;
"this is no place for you!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nom d'un chien</i>," the old woman's voice rose in a
tirade of abuse, her eyes blazed with anger; "I'll do
what I please!  You black coat!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen's face reddened under her insult.
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach you how to talk to your betters," he
said with an oath, and crossing to her with a quick
stride, he laid a rough hand on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
She twisted under his clutch.
</p>

<p>
"You scum!  You toad!" she screamed; "you leave
me be&mdash;&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Her strident, peasant voice carried out into the
hall, and Madame came hurrying in.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she asked.  "What is wrong?"
</p>

<p>
Nanine stopped her scolding and stood sullenly,
while the man explained.
</p>

<p>
"I did not give her permission to come in here,
Madame," he said, "and she refuses to go!"
</p>

<p>
"It is all right," said Madame quietly.  "I told
her to come and arrange the room.  You were busy
with the General.  Go to Mademoiselle Paulette,
Nanine, she is expecting you.  Her commission has
come.  She wants you to help her with her costume."
</p>

<p>
The old woman started for the door, her anger at
the butler making her forget for a moment the paper
that Jacques had brought, and which lay on the desk.
</p>

<p>
The man opened the door.  She went through
heavily, turning just enough for him to see the sneer
she flung at him as she left.
</p>

<p>
"Anything more, Madame?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, and he turned ungraciously,
closing the door after him.
</p>

<p>
Madame stood for a moment by the table.  Her
heart was heavy.  War is cruelest to women, for their
wounds are of the soul; but Marie, opening the door,
met a brave smile, kindly welcoming eyes.  When
Paulette had left her, she had promised to try and
rest, but it was impossible, and nervously she paced
her room, her brain in a turmoil with the thoughts
that harassed her.  Would her plan succeed?
</p>

<p>
It must!  It must!  There must be nothing to prevent
it!  She was filled with a breathless hope as the
bewildering possibility became clear to her, that she
might indeed become the instrument by means of
which France was to be saved!  The thought
transfigured her, lifted her out of the doubt and agony
which had surrounded her.  To be of use to the one
she loved, to save what was more to him than his life,
was her mission.  This accomplished, whatever
happened to her was of no consequence.
</p>

<p>
There were so many things that might interfere
with the success of her plan, Von Pfaffen might
discover it, her note might fall into other hands.  There
was so little time, so much to be done.  She realized
that she must deliver her message as soon as possible.
Perhaps he was waiting even now.  She flung open
her door and hurried down the stair and into the
salon, but here was her husband's mother with her
quiet smile and sweet, kind eyes, and on the little
desk still lay the folded slip of paper that was so
like the one she had placed there.
</p>

<p>
Madame's voice was compassionate as she looked
into the white face.
</p>

<p>
"Come in, dear," she said.  "You must try and
compose yourself, your cheeks are pale.  I think a
walk in the garden would do us both good."
</p>

<p>
"You are so sweet to me, so kind!" murmured
Marie.  "I want you all to love me!"
</p>

<p>
Madame pressed her hand tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"We will, dear," she said.  "You and Paulette and
I will be alone for luncheon to-day.  We can all learn
to know each other better."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked at her wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"I do love you," she said earnestly; "no matter
what happens, I want you to believe that."
</p>

<p>
Madame had divined her condition with the quick
sense of the mother heart, and her kindness doubled.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, "and we can talk of our dear
ones," but the girl was thinking of the little paper
on the desk.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," she gasped, "I can't," and she shrank
away.
</p>

<p>
Madame went to the bell.
</p>

<p>
"Come," she said, "Antoine shall bring us wraps.
The morning air is cool."
</p>

<p>
Marie watched her, a prayer in her heart, to be
able to do something to repay these people for the
love they were giving her.
</p>

<p>
Presently Von Pfaffen opened the door.  He shot
a swift glance at the girl from under his heavy brows.
</p>

<p>
"Madame?" he asked, turning to his mistress.
</p>

<p>
"Bring the scarfs you will find in the entrance
hall, Antoine."
</p>

<p>
As the man left the room, Marie sank breathlessly
into a chair.  Would she be able to carry out her
plan?  Would her pale cheeks, or anything in her
manner, betray her to her tormentor's keen gaze?
</p>

<p>
Madame looked pityingly into the white face.
</p>

<p>
"Come dear, you break my heart with your tragic
eyes.  Remember, I am his mother!"
</p>

<p>
With a cry, the girl started to her feet, but Von
Pfaffen opened the door, the scarfs over his arm, and
again she subsided into her chair, waiting.
</p>

<p>
Madame took a filmy gray scarf and let him wrap
it about her shoulders, and as she went toward the
window, he came to Marie with the ostensible humility
of a servant.
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet, and forced herself toward this
man whom she loathed.
</p>

<p>
As he slipped the wrap about her shoulders, he
muttered under his breath:
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
And in a quick whisper she answered:
</p>

<p>
"On the desk!"
</p>

<p>
Madame at the window, turned.
</p>

<p>
"Coming, dear?" she asked, and as the man stepped
aside Marie followed her out into the garden.
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen watched them disappear, then he
turned hurriedly to the little desk, where he found the
paper that told of Maurice's coming.  Eagerly he
seized it and held it close to his eyes, his face glowing
with triumph.
</p>

<p>
"'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak,'" he read.
"Ah, my Fatherland!" he breathed, then lifting his
fist, shook it fiercely at his surroundings.  "Now
I am rid of all this!"
</p>

<p>
Triumphantly he went through the door, his
shoulders squared, the cloak of the servant dropped
forever.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV
</h3>

<p>
When Nanine and Paulette came down the great
stairway a few minutes later, the girl was trembling
with excitement.  She was dressed in the field uniform
of an army nurse.  Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes
feverishly bright.  The letter telling of her commission
had just reached her that morning and the
long-prepared costume was donned for the first time.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you remember the message, Nanine?"
she asked.  "Tell me again what it said."
</p>

<p>
Patiently the old woman repeated the words.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you, dearie," she said,
"'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak!'"
</p>

<p>
"Sains, that's not far away!  But I must be sure,
Nanine.  I must be sure!  I must see the note.  Where
is it?  Where is it?"
</p>

<p>
Nanine crossed heavily to the little desk.  Not
finding what she sought, she uttered a sharp
exclamation.  The girl flew to her side.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Nanine?  What is it?" she cried
fearfully.
</p>

<p>
The old woman looked up at her blankly.
</p>

<p>
"It's gone!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Paulette echoed her words, her eyes wide and
frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Gone?"
</p>

<p>
Nanine rummaged frantically.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dearie," she wailed, "I put it here, a bit
of paper with 'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak'
written on it.  Where can it be?  Where can it be?"
</p>

<p>
Paulette stood watching her breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Nanine," her voice shook, "there is something
wrong!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman stopped in her search.
</p>

<p>
"Will harm come to him, dearie?" she quavered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Nanine," cried the girl, terror beating at her
heart, "I don't know&mdash;I'm afraid!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon petit chou!</i>" soothed the old woman.  "What
does the loss of the paper matter?  I remember the
words, 'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak,'" but her
deep breast rose and fell with some of the terror that
was shaking her young mistress.
</p>

<p>
"Someone has stolen it!" said Paulette miserably.
"What good does it do for you to remember?
Maurice will be taken back to prison, perhaps shot!"  The
thought sent her hand to her throat in terror.
</p>

<p>
"Shot!"  Nanine stared at her, frightened.  "What
shall we do?" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"We must get word to father."
</p>

<p>
In all Paulette's short life her father had always
been her refuge in time of trouble.  He would know
what to do.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Nanine, why didn't you bring it to me at
once?  Why didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
The old woman shook her head sadly.  For the
sake of those few last moments with her boy this new
trouble had come upon them.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Madame can help us," she said; "let us
ask her!"
</p>

<p>
"Where is she?" asked Paulette eagerly.  "Go find
her at once!  I'll go to her room, she may be there!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman hurried out and Paulette had just
crossed the threshold into the shadows of the outer
hall when, through the long window, came Marie.
Paulette turned and watched her curiously as she went
straight to the little desk.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight of the garden was still in Marie's
eyes, and she did not see the girl standing in the
doorway.  One glance was enough to show her that
the note was gone.  The Fate of France was on the
knees of the gods.  She had done her best.  Turning,
she found herself facing Paulette, whose eyes blazed
with rage and hatred.
</p>

<p>
"So," she cried, "it's you!"
</p>

<p>
Marie recoiled.  For a moment she failed to recognize
the girl in her nurse's garb.  When she did, her
face went white.
</p>

<p>
"I knew I suspected you with reason," went on
Paulette furiously, "no one else could have taken it.
No one would be interested.  Here, we are all friends,
working for each other, but you&mdash;&mdash;" and at the
scorn in her voice, Marie cowered away from her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't&mdash;please," she breathed.
</p>

<p>
Paulette shook her roughly by the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Where is it?" she cried, "the paper that was here;
where is it?"
</p>

<p>
Marie's heart stopped beating.  What could
Paulette know of the paper?
</p>

<p>
"God!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
Her sister-in-law looked at her, sorrow struggling
with hate.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you?  Why did you?" she asked.  "What
have I done?  What has Maurice done?"
</p>

<p>
Marie leaned away from her in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Maurice?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"My sweetheart," went on Paulette, "in a German
prison.  He was to escape!  You have stolen the
note telling where he is to be.  What have you done
with it?"
</p>

<p>
Marie started.  In a flash she understood that she
and Paulette were thinking of different things.  Von
Pfaffen had undoubtedly found her own note.  But
if there had been two notes?  Would this not create
confusion and suspicion in his mind and so defeat her
plan after all?
</p>

<p>
"Listen," she said hurriedly, "I did not take it!
I swear I did not take it.  If someone has it, we must
get there before it is too late!  We must save
Maurice.  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"How can I trust you?" began Paulette bitterly.
</p>

<p>
For a long moment the two women stared at each
other.  At last Marie spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me&mdash;where is he?" she repeated.  "Tell me,
or you will regret it all your life!"
</p>

<p>
There was something so convincing in the tone of
her voice that Paulette found herself believing in
spite of herself.  Unconsciously their positions were
changed; it was Marie who now stood firm and sure
of herself, Paulette who trembled.
</p>

<p>
"He will be at Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak,"
she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Marie's eyes slowly dilated, her face froze into the
expression of an ancient Greek tragic mask.  From
the depths of her very soul came a groan of anguish.
Tensely she repeated the words:
</p>

<p>
"Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at daybreak!"
</p>

<p>
She had thought her plan so sure, so certain to aid
her husband's cause, but whichever way she turned,
she seemed doomed to bring misery to those she loved.
She knew that Von Pfaffen was already well on his
way to the enemy.  The words she had written were
stamped on her memory.  What evil spirit had made
her choose Sains?  Sains, where to-morrow at
daybreak, Paulette's sweetheart, having risked his
life for liberty, would only be reaching this haven
of safety as the guns of the enemy were turned
against its walls.
</p>

<p>
Paulette looked at her, frightened.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she whispered.  At last Marie spoke,
the words coming through her stiff lips in jerking,
staccato tones:
</p>

<p>
"You must go to him," she said; "you must go
now, at once."
</p>

<p>
Go to him herself!  The thought staggered her.
The difficulty!  The danger!  The horrible country
she must cross before she should arrive at Sains,
where battles were even now raging!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how can I go?" she cried, covering her eyes.
"Out there in the midst of all those horrors!  How
can I?"
</p>

<p>
"There is no time to lose," urged Marie, "you are
going to the man you love."
</p>

<p>
Slowly Paulette lifted her brown head.
</p>

<p>
"Can I?  Dare I?" she murmured.
</p>

<p>
In the distance she could hear the sound of the
guns, which all morning had been growing louder and
louder, sometimes swelling into a roar which seemed
to shake the very earth.
</p>

<p>
Marie put her hand on her arm, her whole body
vibrating with emotion.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," she said, "the Germans are to make an
attack on Sains to-morrow at daybreak!"
</p>

<p>
Paulette uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?  What are you?  Who
are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me how I know," went on Marie, "don't
ask me anything, only for God's sake go to Sains!
Warn the town!  Warn the commanding General!  O
hurry, hurry, there is not a moment to lose!"
</p>

<p>
Paulette stared at her fiercely, her hatred and
distrust returning and blazing from her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you were a spy," she cried.  "I knew I
hated you with reason.  Tell me how you know this,
tell me, tell me!"
</p>

<p>
Into Marie's heart came a great sadness, her
punishment was beginning.  How could this girl
believe her?  Would anyone ever trust her?
</p>

<p>
"Your note was stolen," she said.  "The one
who has it is taking it to the enemy!  I know!  I
tried to help my husband's cause, but in doing so I
have endangered Maurice's life.  Oh, Paulette, I
thought that what I did was for the best.  Don't look
at me like that.  Some day you will understand!"
</p>

<p>
Paulette was wild with rage.  This woman whom
they had made one of themselves, whom her parents
had taken to their hearts and given the position due
the wife of their beloved son, had betrayed them.  But
there was a punishment for such as she.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have you shot," she panted.  "I'll have the
soldiers drag you to prison for the spy that you
are&mdash;&mdash;" but Marie was at her side.
</p>

<p>
"Paulette," she said earnestly, "will you allow your
hatred and distrust of me to stand in the way of
doing a great service for France and saving Maurice?
There is no doubt that the Germans will attack Sains
to-morrow at dawn.  I need not tell you what it
would mean to your countrymen to know this and
prepare for their coming.  If you do not heed me,
you will never know happiness again!  This is the
opportunity of your whole life to serve the cause you
love.  Do not cast it aside!  Go to Sains!  Save the
city!  Save your love, then come back and do whatever
you will to me, only, for God's sake, hurry!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice was so earnest, so vibrant with the desire
that prompted her, that in spite of her suspicion the
girl paused and looked into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If I could only trust you," she said.
</p>

<p>
Quick to sense the momentary lowering of the
barriers, Marie put a pleading hand on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"You can," she said, "oh, do believe me.  The cause
you love is as dear to me as to you.  You must go,
there is no other way!"  Her eyes rested on the little
insignia on the collar of the girl's costume, and
mentally following her gaze, Paulette became suddenly
aware of her uniform.  This would be the means
of reaching Maurice.  Her hands would nurse him
after all.  He would be her first patient.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes cleared of the vision of blood and terror,
the hatred and distrust died in her heart.  Her
shoulders squared with the strength of her father,
her chin lifted with her mother's poise.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go," she said.  "I am a soldier's daughter!
I am to be a soldier's bride!  I'll go!"
</p>

<p>
"Go now," urged Marie; "it isn't far.  I swear I
didn't take it.  Won't you believe me?  It isn't your
happiness that is threatened.  Oh, believe me!
Believe me!"
</p>

<p>
"If I am only in time," breathed Paulette, as she
turned to go.
</p>

<p>
Marie followed her to the window.
</p>

<p>
"Little sister," she pleaded, "you at least I would
save unhappiness.  God speed!" and suddenly,
believing, Paulette turned and flung her arms about
her neck, then with her head held high, she went out
through the garden.
</p>

<p>
Marie watched her go.  How many partings there
had been in these short hours.  She watched Nanine
close and bar the heavy gates after the slender figure,
drying her eyes with the back of her hand as she
did so.
</p>

<p>
"'Sains&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at dawn!'" the words were
burned into her brain.  Her head went down on her
arms across the little desk.
</p>

<p>
From the depths of the garden, Madame saw the
girl go through the gate, and hurried into the salon.
Her quick step in the hall roused Marie.  She rose to
meet her.
</p>

<p>
"She has gone, <i>ma mère</i>," she told her gently; "she
has gone to the man she loves."
</p>

<p>
"Gone&mdash;my little Paulette, gone?  Out there,
without a word to me," her face was suddenly old,
gray, the lines about her mouth seemed drawn with
a shaded pencil.
</p>

<p>
"A message came this morning," said Marie; "it
told of Maurice's escape.  Someone has intercepted it,
and Paulette, fearing for his safety, has gone to him."
</p>

<p>
"We have been waiting for this message," said
Madame, "but Paulette, alone!  Out there!"  She
looked toward the horizon from whence came the
deep-throated roar of the guns, savage and menacing.
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly she broke down.  Bowing her proud
head in her hands she wept bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Marie stood beside her, silent, until just as
suddenly she gained control of herself again.  The white
head rose proudly, the bright brown eyes shone
bravely through their tears.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad she has gone," she said.  "I would not
have it otherwise.  She must go to help the man she
loves, if she can!  I'm glad she was brave enough
to go."
</p>

<p>
Marie looked at her wonderingly.  How fine she
was, how strong and true.  Why could she not have
been as brave as this?  She saw herself as she had
been, a pitiful, weak creature, almost ready to sell
her soul to tie herself like a millstone about the neck
of the man she loved.  She knew that even now she
was dreading the scorn she would see in this kind face
when she knew all the truth concerning her.  But
she thought of Gerome, with his lofty ideals; she
thought of Paulette forgetting her dread of the
horrors "out there," taking her young life into her
hands willingly, eagerly, to serve, if she could, both
France and the man she loved, and she knew that she,
too, would accept her martyrdom gladly for the cause
that was theirs.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV
</h3>

<p>
The long road that led through the village and
on into Sains lay before Paulette like an unexplored
country.  The familiar smoothness was gone, cut into
by heavy army wagons and many marching feet.  The
fields themselves that bordered its dusty edges were
trampled and bare.  Even the tall poplars, standing
like sentinels along its way, were draggled and unkempt.
</p>

<p>
When the gates closed on her, Paulette drew a
quick breath as she looked about her.  How often
she had ridden through the green shadows of these
familiar lanes with Maurice; now the difference
frightened her.
</p>

<p>
She turned to look at the gray towers where they
showed above the trees.  Would she ever see them
again, she wondered?  Poor little Paulette, the way
before her was a long and weary one, but she knew
if she were only in time nothing else mattered.
</p>

<p>
Resolutely she turned her face away from her beloved
home and started on her journey.  The muffled
roar of the guns which had been coming to them ever
since the war began seemed deeper, more menacing
now that she was outside the shelter of the château
walls, but until she neared the village, the road was
deserted.  She hurried down the pretty little street
that wound among the houses.  Here and there
soldiers lounged against the doorsteps and gazed
curiously at her under their caps.  Once she flattened
herself against a wall to let a company swing by
through the narrow street.  Once she stumbled out
of the way of an automobile filled with officers.  Once
a woman leaned out of an upper window and waved
to her as she passed, but without turning her head
Paulette hurried on.
</p>

<p>
At the tiny railroad station she found the
platform crowded with soldiers, a detachment of men
waiting to be sent along the line.  The officer in
charge, a tall smooth-faced youngster, greeted her
politely.  She showed him her orders and begged to
be allowed to stop off at Sains.  He piloted her down
the platform, alongside of which there stood little
gray box-cars.  Out of the windows crowded round
heads, black, brown, yellow; laughing, joking, smoking.
</p>

<p>
But with all the willingness in the world, there was
no corner for her, and she was just turning away
disappointed when a gray motor ambulance came
alongside the platform.  The driver called out, seeing
her uniform:
</p>

<p>
"There's room for you," he said cheerily, reaching
out a helping hand.
</p>

<p>
"I have an important message for the commanding
officer at Sains," said Paulette.  "Will you take me
there as quickly as possible?"
</p>

<p>
She climbed up to the seat beside him.  The
ambulance turned about and as it swung into top
speed the soldiers in the little cars waved their caps
to them.
</p>

<p>
The driver and his orderly laughed and joked as
the machine sped along and tried to draw her into
their conversation, quite as though it were a pleasure
excursion they were having.
</p>

<p>
Outside the village the road wound steeply up a
hill and then dipped in a great curve down to the
river bank.
</p>

<p>
She began to see more and more frequently the
work of the guns which up to now she had only
heard.  Deep furrows cut into the fields by exploding
shells, ruined barns with great gaping holes in their
sides, farm houses, roofless, with empty, staring
windows.  She could see the dust of the supply trains
crawling along the horizon, and occasionally the
white cloud of a bursting shell.
</p>

<p>
Presently the ambulance drew up at a field hospital.
Nurses robed like herself hurried from one to
another of the shattered forms lying in the straw.
Doctors with tired faces went silently to and fro.
Paulette's heart shrank from the suffering about her,
she tried to shut from her eyes the pitiful sights, to
close her ears to the moans and cries, but they beat
against her strained nerves, almost breaking them.
</p>

<p>
This ambulance was to go no further.  But there
was a constant stream going on toward Sains.  Into
one of these she climbed and in a moment they were
speeding on their way again, past long lines of
soldiers, some resting by the road, others trudging
rhythmically along, their faces turned toward the
sound of the guns.  The line seemed unending.  These
were the men who were standing between France and
unthinkable disaster.
</p>

<p>
How proud she was of them!  Her courage
returned.  Her nostrils dilated.  They represented
France, and she was one of them!
</p>

<p>
This message that she bore might enable them to
inflict a blow upon the enemy that would sweep him
from her beloved country forever!
</p>

<p>
At last, the distant spires of Sains came in sight,
and her heart was full of the hope that she might
not be too late.
</p>

<p>
Back at the château, a mother's heart was following
her with a prayer for her safety and another
woman paced restlessly up and down, pausing
frequently at the window to look with straining eyes
toward Sains, hoping, praying with her whole soul
that she would reach there in time.
</p>

<p>
At Draise, not many miles away, a great army was
gathering quietly, secretly, waiting for the dawn and
success, while here, toward the ancient spires which
were their guide, another army in field gray and
spiked helmets was directing its guns; and between
them, on the long stretch of dusty road, cut and
slashed by army wagons and many marching feet, the
ambulance sped the girl on her way, the love of one of
this world of men filling her heart, a prayer on her
lips that the message she carried might bring victory.
</p>

<p>
When they drew up at the gates of Sains, Paulette's
new uniform was dusty and soiled.  The tall spires
of the cathedral and the red roofs of the houses
sparkled in the afternoon sunshine as she entered the
town.  Here and there the walls lay in crumbling
heaps, reminders of the German shells.  Near the
gate several soldiers were lounging.  One man, his
cap pulled low over his eyes, his rifle against his
shoulder, paced back and forth.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant in command approached her.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you wish to go, Mademoiselle?" he
asked politely.
</p>

<p>
"I must go to Headquarters.  I am to see the
officer in command there.  It is very important!"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant called one of the men.
</p>

<p>
"Guerin," he said, "conduct this lady to
Headquarters.  See that she is taken care of.
Understand?"
</p>

<p>
The man saluted.
</p>

<p>
"This way, Mademoiselle," he said, and they
hurried down one street, across another, and through
a ruined archway, riddled by German shot.  Sometimes
they were obliged to scramble over heaps of
brick and mortar and broken glass where some shell
had struck.  Presently they came out into the market-place.
The broad, open space was deserted, save for
the sentries pacing to and fro.  Around the fountain
in the center were piled heavy burlap bags, evidently
filled with grain.  The Hotel de Ville, which formed
one side of the square, had part of its roof gone, and
a heap of dust and mortar lay piled against one side.
The Cathedral, opposite, whose spires had been their
guide all day, was battered and crumpled, a great
empty space where the beautiful glass of the rose
window had been.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the Hotel de Ville a sentry
challenged them.  There was a whispered word with her
guide.  The man looked at her sharply and saluted.
</p>

<p>
"Pass, Mademoiselle," he said.
</p>

<p>
They stumbled up a dark stair, and across a wide,
dusty hall lined with doors, closed and bolted for the
most part.  At the far end, Guerin bade her halt and
rapped loudly on the panel of a door standing partly
ajar.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Entrez</i>," called a hoarse voice, and he pushed it
open with a jerk of his elbow and motioned her to
enter.
</p>

<p>
Paulette stepped across the threshold.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the room a man with thick iron-gray
hair was writing at a table.  At his side stood
an orderly waiting, and under a window a young
officer sat before a telegraph instrument.
</p>

<p>
He rose as they entered and came forward.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he said and Guerin saluted stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"I am the daughter of General de la Motte.  I
have important information for the commanding
officer," began Paulette.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at her keenly for a moment, then
turned to the man at the table.
</p>

<p>
"General," he said, "Mademoiselle de la Motte has
something of importance to say to you!"
</p>

<p>
The iron-gray head lifted and Paulette saw a finely
formed face with a firm, resolute mouth and a pair of
very keen steel-gray eyes.
</p>

<p>
He rose and bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle de la Motte?  By any chance of
the family of General Phillipe de la Motte?"
</p>

<p>
"His daughter, sir!"
</p>

<p>
A bright smile lighted his face, relieving it of all
its sternness.  He extended his hand.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great pleasure, Mademoiselle," he said;
"pray be seated and tell me what I can do for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said, "but I prefer to stand.
What I have to tell you is very important!"  She
paused for a moment and the General fixed his keen
eyes upon hers.  "I have just come from the château.
I received information this morning that the enemy is
to attack Sains to-morrow at daybreak."
</p>

<p>
The General was a man long schooled to mask his
emotions, and his face gave no sign except a barely
perceptible tightening of the muscles about the mouth
and a deeper gleam in his clear eyes.
</p>

<p>
"This is important, Mademoiselle.  Are you sure
that it is authentic?"
</p>

<p>
"I have every reason to believe so, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"How long have you known it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Just a few hours," she said.  "I came here as fast
as I could!"
</p>

<p>
"You say you received this information at the
château this morning?"  She bowed.  "Can you tell
me how this became known to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I regret, Monsieur, that I am not at liberty to
do so!"
</p>

<p>
"How many others know of this?"
</p>

<p>
"One other, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"The source of your information?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
He looked searchingly into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure this other is loyal to our cause?"
</p>

<p>
The girl paused.  Through her mind ran the events
of the past few hours.
</p>

<p>
Her brother's wife was of the enemy's blood.  She
had hated and distrusted her, and this morning her
suspicions had seemed to be confirmed.  Was she
sure of her loyalty?  Marie's eyes seemed to look
into hers.  Again she heard her voice saying,
</p>

<p>
"The cause you love is as dear to me as to you!"
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes to the General's.
</p>

<p>
"The other is loyal!" she said.
</p>

<p>
He turned from her and paced the room thoughtfully,
his hands behind his back, his brows contracted.
</p>

<p>
"If what you say is true," he said at last, pausing
before her, "then you have done France a great
service.  Wait here a moment."  He crossed the
room, and spoke in an undertone to the officer in
waiting, who saluted and went out, accompanied by
the orderly.  Then he turned to Paulette, smiling.
"In the name of France, I thank you, Mademoiselle,
for what you have done to-day.  Can I be of any
service to you?"
</p>

<p>
Paulette looked at him piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any news of Captain le Cerf?" she asked
eagerly.  "We have had word that he had escaped
from Belgium and was to arrive here to-day.  He is
my fiancé, Monsieur."
</p>

<p>
The General smiled kindly.
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you, Mademoiselle," he said; "the
Captain and his family are dear friends of mine.  I
have good news for you!  He has arrived safely."
</p>

<p>
He touched a bell and an orderly entered.  There
was a whispered word or two, and the man, saluting,
left the room.
</p>

<p>
Paulette's eyes glowed.  All sense of fatigue left
her.  She would see him soon.  Her heart throbbed
Suffocatingly.
</p>

<p>
The General looked at her benevolently.  With a
Frenchman's love of romance which is never absent,
even in the face of grave danger, he watched the
flush on her cheeks, her parted lips, and with a sigh
for his own lost youth, he picked up his pen again
and bent over his writing.
</p>

<p>
Presently, heavy steps came down the hall and a
knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," called the General without raising his
head, and the young officer reentered, followed by a
slim figure in a soiled uniform.
</p>

<p>
Paulette leaped to her feet.  With a cry she flew
across the room and into the arms of Maurice.  His
drawn face was almost as gray as his eyes, his
shoulders thin, though now squared with hope and
determination, his cheeks hollow and heavily lined.
There were purple shadows under his eyes and his
hands shook pitifully as he caressed her hair.
</p>

<p>
The General patted his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Captain," he said kindly; "you're not
strong yet, sit down," and Maurice let them lead him
to a chair.
</p>

<p>
Paulette knelt beside him, her arms about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Maurice, Maurice, I've missed you so," she
murmured; "you're not going to leave me ever again!"
</p>

<p>
He held his lips tenderly against her forehead.
</p>

<p>
General de Line stood looking down on them.
</p>

<p>
"Captain," he said, "do you think you are strong
enough to travel to-night?  I must get you both
away from Sains as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
Something in his tone made Maurice look up at
him inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"We have had news that the enemy are to attack
here at dawn, you must be safely away by then.
That is the least France can do in return for the
service Mademoiselle has rendered," and he bowed
gallantly to the girl.
</p>

<p>
Maurice looked from one to the other not understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle will explain," said the General,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
Maurice put his feeble arms close about the girl's
trembling shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"My dearest one," he murmured, "I am so proud
to know that you have served France.  You must tell
me everything.  We must be married at once!  And
then, are you willing to go with me, wreck that I
am, wherever I go?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him adoringly.
</p>

<p>
"How can you ask me?" she cried; "don't you
know?"
</p>

<p>
Le Cerf rose shakily to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"My General," he said, "Mademoiselle and I are to
be married at once, if you can make it possible to
have the <i>curé</i> here, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And then," finished the General with a fatherly
smile, "you will go with Captain Merton to Calais;
he drives there within the hour with these despatches.
You will cross to England where your parents are.
I have a letter from them.  They write they have
taken a house, and, of course, are most anxious to
see you.  You will stay with them until you are
strong."
</p>

<p>
Maurice's eyes held Paulette's.
</p>

<p>
"Will you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She looked down at her nurse's uniform.
</p>

<p>
"I have been ordered to St. Quentin for duty," she
faltered.
</p>

<p>
The General broke in hastily:
</p>

<p>
"I will adjust that, my dear young lady," he said
kindly.
</p>

<p>
A quick vision of her mother, her father, her home,
flashed across her mind, but she looked up into
Maurice's eyes, infinite love in hers.  Where he was,
was home to her.  He needed her.  She asked herself
no further questions.
</p>

<p>
She went through the hurried marriage like one
in a dream.  She was scarcely conscious of the
black-frocked <i>curé</i>, of the General standing on one side of
him, and Maurice who had left her so short a time
ago, strong and virile, shaking against her arm.
</p>

<p>
She scarcely remembered the words or their
responses; she had a dim recollection of the closing
lines of the ceremony, of Maurice's lips on hers.  Then
came the quick run down the dark stairs and into the
waiting car, the wild flight through the growing
dusk and into the deepening night, stopping every
now and then to answer the challenging sentries.  She
dared not think of what the morning would bring.
She could only hope that the message she had brought
had been in time to be of service.  Her memory still
held the vivid picture of her sister-in-law's agonized
face when she had hurried her off to Sains.  How
could Marie have known, she wondered?  Who had
it been in their own loyal household who had stolen
the note?  Her head ached with the endless repetition
of her questions to which she could find no answer.
</p>

<p>
She looked down on the dear head pillowed on her
arm and drew the heavy army blanket closer about
them both, thanking God that he was safe.
</p>

<p>
Toward dawn they came in sight of Calais.  The
tall, ugly spires of Notre Dame showed gray against
the brightening sky.  There was a brief pause at the
gates of the fortress, a short parley with some soldiers
and one or two keen-eyed officers&mdash;another quick dash
across the Place d'Arme to the New Harbor.
</p>

<p>
Captain Merton shook their hands cheerily as he
left them.
</p>

<p>
With the heavy army blanket as their only luggage,
they boarded the boat for Dover.
</p>

<p>
Her face was turned away from France, the water
slipping under the keel of the Channel boat was
carrying her from everything she had ever loved,
carrying her and the man who was to fill her life from
now on, into a strange land.
</p>

<p>
When she had wrapped Maurice in the warm folds,
Paulette sat with his hands close clasped in hers.  Just
as the first rays of the morning sun sparkled on the
white cliffs of Dover, showing vaguely on the horizon
eighteen miles away across the Channel, borne on the
fresh salt breeze, came a deep-throated, far-away
roar.  She stiffened in her chair and bent her ear to
listen.
</p>

<p>
The attack had come!  But her warning would
render it futile.  Her trust in Marie was vindicated.
</p>

<p>
Her heart swelled with pride.  Her lips murmured
a prayer of thankfulness, her fingers clung closer to
the feeble ones they held.  For the first time in many
months she was at peace.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI
</h3>

<p>
In the château, Madame and Marie, together with
the old Breton woman, were the only ones left.  After
Paulette's departure they searched for Antoine, but
found that he had gone, as Marie knew he would be.
</p>

<p>
The long day had worn away somehow.  Madame
went up to her room and shut herself in.  Marie's
nerves, almost at the breaking-point, sent her
feverishly wandering about the house and grounds,
up and down and back and forth, never seeming to
find a place to rest.  Once or twice she came back to
the gate-house and tried to talk to Angéle, but the
girl, her eyes red and swollen, her face mottled with
weeping, splashed and scrubbed the already immaculate
floor in a frenzy of industry, her conversation
limited to monosyllables, and Marie turned back
again to her own room.
</p>

<p>
She had brought with her from Paris materials for
the little <i>layette</i> that would be needed, but her hands
shook so over the tiny garments that the needle ran
deeply into her finger and the blood stained the white
linen.  She stared at the red spot with wild eyes.
What a horrible omen, she thought, what a frightful
thing.  Blood stains on her baby's clothes!  Did that
mean that her efforts at reparation had come too
late?
</p>

<p>
She threw aside the bit of linen as though it
scorched her fingers, and fell on her knees in agony.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Mother," she began.  Surely the blessed
Virgin would hear a woman who longed so sincerely
to right whatever wrong she had done.
</p>

<p>
When she rose from her knees it was with renewed
courage and hope.  The one poignant remorse
that stabbed her was that when Gerome had told her
of his love, she had not bared to him her life in
Vienna.  How much sorrow, how many endless days
of regret are caused by the first deception practised
from a false sense of pride or for the purpose of
hiding some truth about ourselves which if disclosed
might cause us at the time embarrassment, or pain.
Often whatever is gained is paid for a hundredfold
by the humiliation and grief that follows when the
truth must be told.
</p>

<p>
To Marie, pacing her room, came the full realization
of this.  If she had only confided in Gerome, he
might have forgiven her and they would have been
almost as happy as they had been, without this
dreadful suffering being possible.  She could then
have denounced Von Pfaffen when she had found
herself face to face with him again.
</p>

<p>
The burning tears coursed down her cheeks, and
with all her soul she prayed to be given the
opportunity to tell her husband everything.
</p>

<p>
Toward evening Madame knocked at her door.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go down to the salon, dear," she said.  "I
shall bring little Angéle up to the house and we
will stay together to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>Maman</i>," answered Marie, through the
door; "I shall be down directly."
</p>

<p>
As Madame's footsteps died away, she hastily
smoothed her hair and refreshed her face with water,
then went downstairs to join the others in the long
vigil that was before them.
</p>

<p>
All night long the voice of the guns rose in deafening
crescendo, making sleep impossible, while on the
horizon, orange, crimson, and mauve flashes broke
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
All night long the four women sat together in the
little salon, waiting for what they dared not put into
words.
</p>

<p>
Madame sat silent and tragic in her great chair,
her delicate hands clasped loosely in her lap.  Her
eyes looked far away, beyond to-night, beyond
to-morrow, even beyond this world.
</p>

<p>
Angéle whimpered in her corner.
</p>

<p>
Marie staring from one to the other, wondered
what they would say when they knew everything.
</p>

<p>
The roar of the guns was incessant, rolling,
thundering, like mighty waves beating against
granite cliffs, deafening, appalling, filling all the air
with an agony of sound.  Then just before dawn,
suddenly, as though a giant hand had intervened,
the tumult ceased and was followed by a breathless
hush.  The women looked at one another.  There
was something in this unusual stillness that was
ominous, fearful, more terrible than had been the
pandemonium of sound.
</p>

<p>
Far away a cock crowed and was answered by
another.  The wind stirred among the leaves and set
them to whispering.  Then they heard a distant,
intermittent rattle, sharp, spiteful, venomous,
unmistakable to anyone who had ever heard it.  It was
the sound of rifles and machine guns.  Instantly they
understood.  That which shot and shell had begun,
the bayonet was to finish.  The artillery had ceased,
to permit the men to come out of the trenches!  To
go over the top!  To charge!
</p>

<p>
As the light grew, the staccato rattle of the distant
rifle fire was interrupted every now and again
by a dull boom.  The enemy was answering.
</p>

<p>
Several times a terrible detonation roared in their
ears, the windows shook with the concussion, the very
rafters of the old château shivered and trembled,
and across the fields a great column of black smoke
and dirt spouted wildly in the air where a shell had
struck and burst.
</p>

<p>
Madame, standing tall and erect by the window,
vibrated with every sound of the distant battle.  She
was fighting by the side of her men, this woman,
reared in luxury, in whose veins ran the blood of her
country's best, whose indomitable will lifted her
above all difficulties, leveled all obstacles and knew
no fear.  A worthy mother of a noble son!
</p>

<p>
Old Nanine sat dry-eyed, seemingly unconscious
of the sounds of the conflict about them.  Centuries
of passive obedience, of unreasoning sacrifice, had
left its heritage of outward indifference.  Stolid,
emotionless, she waited, but in the core of her heart
burned the unquenchable flame of mother-love for the
last son, out there, where flesh and blood was holding
its unequal contest against steel and iron.
</p>

<p>
Silent, with white cheeks, and lips tightly
compressed sat Marie, every nerve strained taut, as her
imagination carried her into the battle.  Each shot
that was fired seemed aimed at her own heart, each
sound in the air shrieked aloud of some calamity to
Gerome.  She knew that she would gladly have
undergone whatever tortures could be given her to
know that he would come back to her, maimed, torn,
bleeding, no matter how, but only come back to her!
</p>

<p>
As the reverberations grew louder and more
terrifying, she rose to her feet, and went to the
window beside Madame.
</p>

<p>
"God give them victory!" she breathed at last.
</p>

<p>
Madame stared at the ridge of the hill where the
road wound over to Draise.
</p>

<p>
"My husband is there," she said, with calm exultation,
"my brothers are there; my son is there."
</p>

<p>
Marie flung out her arms, an agony of longing in
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she cried, "Gerome!"
</p>

<p>
"And somewhere out among it all," went on
Madame, in that strange, vibrant voice, her eyes never
leaving the horizon, "somewhere out there is my little
Paulette, my baby, gone from our shelter to the man
she loves."
</p>

<p>
"She is taking to him much more than her love!"
murmured Marie, but Madame did not seem to hear
her.
</p>

<p>
"And now," she said, wondering, "even Antoine is
gone!"
</p>

<p>
Marie closed her eyes with a shudder of horror.
Antoine!  How she loathed even the mention of his
name.  His going had brought about all this!  For
the thousandth time she asked herself if it would not
have been better to have denounced him at once.
</p>

<p>
"Antoine left without a word, without a sign.
Even he must fight for his country," went on
Madame's steady voice.
</p>

<p>
Marie rose to her feet and paced up and down the
room.
</p>

<p>
"When will it be over?" she cried.  "When will it
be over?"
</p>

<p>
Madame turned her eyes from the ridge which lay
incongruously sparkling in the early sunshine, while
the air shook with the terrific thunder of the guns,
shouting their message of death and destruction.
</p>

<p>
"We women must watch and wait," she said.
"Daughters of men!  Wives of men!  Mothers of
men!"
</p>

<p>
Marie stopped in her restless pacing.
</p>

<p>
"Mothers of men!" she whispered.  When the day
of reckoning came, what would she say to Gerome's
child, if it should be a son?  Would he be able to
look into her eyes with pride, or would her memory
be hateful to him?
</p>

<p>
Madame looked at her with tender understanding.
</p>

<p>
"It is for that, dear," she said, "we women must
watch and wait!"
</p>

<p>
To watch and wait!  If that were all!  This great
struggle must end some day.  And to each of these
women would be given her measure of sorrow.  The
agony of suspense would be over.
</p>

<p>
But for her it was different.
</p>

<p>
No matter what the consequences were of her effort
to circumvent the enemy, the fact of her having
withheld the truth from her husband might never cease to
bear its harvest of evil.
</p>

<p>
She threw herself face down again on the couch,
her shoulders heaving convulsively, her slight frame
torn with the bitterness of her sorrow.
</p>

<p>
Nanine looked at her stolidly.
</p>

<p>
"There are others of us," she said, "who have our
griefs."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Nanine," said Madame sympathetically,
"you have given two sons, and now the youngest,
Jacques, is out there!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman's eyes were dry, her face was set.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madame," she said; "what are women for?
In peaceful times the country takes our money for
the army, and when war comes we must give our men
who've earned the money!"
</p>

<p>
Marie lifted herself from among the pillows and
stared at her wonderingly through her red, swollen
lids.
</p>

<p>
"And you'd give all?" she asked, "everything you
care for, everything, for your country?"
</p>

<p>
"But yes," the old woman's answer was a matter
of course; "what else is there to do?"
</p>

<p>
"We all would!"  Madame spoke with the voice of
France.  "Our men are not fighting for material
gain, but in defense of our homes.  The enemy's heel
is on the breast of our beloved country, and to
remove his hated tread that defaces our sacred soil, we
will give our loved ones to the last man!"
</p>

<p>
Her words woke in Marie's heart the eager, breathless
emotion that comes into being with the sound of
martial music.
</p>

<p>
"I'm beginning to understand what all that means,"
she said.  "This wonderful love that came to me
seemed greater than anything in the world; it made
me happier than I ever dreamed of being.  If this
cause for which he is fighting is more glorious, I want
to give him to it.  I want to make the sacrifice.  But
oh, it's hard, it's terribly hard!"
</p>

<p>
Madame put her arm about the shaking shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You are not strong," she said, gently smoothing
the girl's hair as she let her weep against her
shoulder.  After a moment she went on, "Don't you
think that I know the wonder, the beauty of a great
love?  Don't you think I realize what it means?
Every woman does, from Nanine here, and little
Angéle, to the greatest queen, but each of us sees it
differently.  Real love is unselfish, it makes you want
to give as well as receive.  It will not let you choke
with clinging arms!"
</p>

<p>
The old woman had followed her mistress' words
with wonder, not understanding, but feeling the
thought that lay back of them with the intuition of
universal womanhood.
</p>

<p>
"Even when a poor peasant woman like me cares
for her man like I cared for mine," she said, "you
fight for him, with him, but you don't hang onto his
coat-tails when he wants to fight for himself."
</p>

<p>
Madame rose and crossed to the window, where she
stood looking in the direction from whence came the
incessant thunder of the guns.
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather have my boy die out there," she said
proudly, "fighting in defense of his country, than to
know he did not have the will to go."
</p>

<p>
Marie stumbled across the room and threw herself
at Madame's feet, her arms about her knees.
</p>

<p>
"You wonderful woman," she cried.  "His mother,
can you forgive me?  How different everything would
have been if my own mother had lived!"
</p>

<p>
Madame tried to raise her.
</p>

<p>
"Marie dear," she pleaded, "don't; there is nothing
you have done, excepting love my boy too much.
Come, don't ask my forgiveness for that!" but Marie
clung about her knees, still weeping bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know," she sobbed, "you can't know
how much I love him!  And I am so unworthy!"
</p>

<p>
Madame stooped and lifted her to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"You must not feel unhappy because you are of
our enemies' blood," she said; "no one questions your
loyalty to our cause!"
</p>

<p>
But Marie covered her ears to shut out the sounds
that grew louder and louder every minute, and sank
miserably into a chair.
</p>

<p>
Angéle's fingers were busy again with her rosary,
her lips with a prayer, and old Nanine crossed
herself.
</p>

<p>
At the window Madame stood watching, her soul
in her eyes.  Over the brow of the hill long lines of
gray motors were crawling, on the sides of which she
could just make out a blood-red cross.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of pain touched her heart.  The never-ending
line of ambulances, what agony, what misery
they carried.  An hour ago splendid young manhood,
now shattered wrecks!
</p>

<p>
And going in the opposite direction swung a long
blue column of marching men.  Strong, virile, filled
with courage!  Forward!  Onward!  For France!
</p>

<p>
Faintly, through the dull roaring, came the sound
of the Marseillaise.
</p>

<p>
She stretched out her arms to them in an ecstasy
of patriotism.  Her voice clear and sweet as a bugle.
</p>

<p>
"March on," she cried.  "March on&mdash;to victory or
death!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII
</h3>

<p>
The morning wore on.  The firing grew nearer,
louder, more insistent.  Madame, watching at the
window, suddenly uttered a cry.  The others rushed
to her side.
</p>

<p>
Outside on the road an ambulance had stopped,
gone on again, and through the gates came two
soldiers bearing a stretcher.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, tenderly, they carried their burden
toward the house.
</p>

<p>
The women stared through the window with an
agony of apprehension, each with the name of the
one she loved best trembling on her lips.  Was it
Gerome&mdash;the General&mdash;Jacques?
</p>

<p>
The men entered through the long window the
women opened for them, and laid their burden on the
couch.  As they did so, the fainting man revived and
lifted his head.  With a cry Nanine stumbled to his
side.
</p>

<p>
"Jacques!  Jacques!  Couldn't I save one of the
three?"
</p>

<p>
The boy turned his eyes toward her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right, mother," he said bravely.
</p>

<p>
The old woman fondled him, the slow tears following
the wrinkles down her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"My boy," she cried, brokenly, "my last one; is
it bad?"
</p>

<p>
He turned his head on the cushion she had placed
under it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a sergeant, mother," he murmured, his eyes
lighting up.
</p>

<p>
Little Angéle was standing staring down at him,
her pretty mouth quivering, her breast fluttering.
She was afraid, somehow, to speak, to call his
attention to herself.
</p>

<p>
Marie looked on helplessly, with a feeling of
detachment.  She felt as one in a dream.  These men
who had stared death in the face within so brief a
time, seemed unreal to her.
</p>

<p>
Madame turned to one of the stretcher-bearers.
</p>

<p>
"What is happening out there?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, his eyes, in his square,
mud-plastered face, bloodshot from lack of sleep.
</p>

<p>
"We don't know, Madame," he said, removing his
cap; "we can't tell, we can only hope."
</p>

<p>
She turned to the other man and recoiled slightly.
</p>

<p>
He wore the field-gray uniform of a German
private soldier.  His face was pale and expressionless,
a red stubble covered his cheeks and chin.
Under one eye was a gash with the blood blackened
on it and surrounded by purple discolorations.
There was a bloody rag around his closely cropped
head, and his spiked helmet sat upon this in a
grotesquely jaunty fashion.
</p>

<p>
"What is this man doing here?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"He is a prisoner, Madame."  The orderly
hunched an expressive shoulder toward Jacques, "he
helped bring him in."
</p>

<p>
Madame's eyes were on the bloody bandage.
</p>

<p>
"You are hurt, too," she said.
</p>

<p>
The man smiled, a wan, crooked smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Madame," he said in guttural French.  "It
is not serious."  The orderly frowned as he looked
from one to the other.
</p>

<p>
"They both need patching up," he said; "can you
get water and bandages and perhaps something to
eat?"
</p>

<p>
Nanine was still bending over Jacques, and Angéle,
too, was on her knees beside the couch as Madame
turned to go.
</p>

<p>
Marie touched her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Let me help," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear, you go," she said softly.  It would do
the girl good, she thought, to be occupied in this
service.  "Bring water and some food."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the pale face of the German soldier went
a shade whiter, he staggered a step toward the
couch and put out a shaking hand to steady himself.
Nanine, suspicious of his uniform, made a quick
gesture of protection over her wounded son, but the
boy looked up quickly.
</p>

<p>
"He's all right, mother," he said; "he's my friend."
</p>

<p>
"Your friend," said Madame in astonishment.  To
these women the uniform this man was wearing was
symbolic of everything barbarous.
</p>

<p>
Jacques held up a feeble hand and clasped the one
the German held out to him.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't be here, if it weren't for him," he said
brokenly.  "We charged early this morning.  We
reached their first trench.  I got this," he laid his
free hand on his side.  "I didn't know anything for
awhile.  When I came to, the rest of our boys had
gone on and left me behind.  God, I was thirsty&mdash;I
tried to crawl&mdash;&mdash;" the horror of it all twisted his
face in an agony of memory.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, <i>mon lapin</i>, hush," whispered his mother,
but the boy went on:
</p>

<p>
"I tried to crawl," he panted; "I couldn't!  Over
me, around me, beside me&mdash;dead
bodies&mdash;everywhere&mdash;&mdash;"  He tightened
his grasp on the German's
hand; "then he dragged himself over to me&mdash;he had
some water&mdash;I believe I got most of it&mdash;he opened
his kit and gave me first aid&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Madame looked on in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"One of the enemy to do such a thing!" she
wondered.  It was incredible to think that two men who
only so short a time before had been striving for each
other's lives should now call one another "friend."
</p>

<p>
Through the door came Marie with a tray of
bread and coffee, and a basin of water and some
bandages.
</p>

<p>
The German put his hand against the bloody rag
about his head.
</p>

<p>
"We are not enemies now," he said in his guttural
French, "only fellow-sufferers!"
</p>

<p>
"Fellow-sufferers," Marie echoed the words from
the depth of her heart, as she handed the man a cup
of the hot coffee.
</p>

<p>
The German took it with a polite bow.
</p>

<p>
"You are good to me," he said simply.
</p>

<p>
"In spite of the uniform you wear," said Madame,
"we will do our best for you."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"It is our countries who are at war," he said, "not
we!"
</p>

<p>
Marie's eyes turned toward the far horizon where
the rumble of the guns still thundered unceasingly.
</p>

<p>
"It is the countries who are at war," she echoed,
"and between them men's bodies and women's hearts
are broken!"
</p>

<p>
Jacques was lying on his pillow, white-faced and
with closed lids.
</p>

<p>
His mother leaned back on her heels and looked
at him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, and her voice broke, "it is the
people who suffer."
</p>

<p>
Her mistress' white head raised itself proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Here in France," she said, "the people and the
country are one.  We are fighting to preserve that
unity."
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence, then Marie turned
to fill the German prisoner's cup.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the pity of it all," she said under her breath.
</p>

<p>
The man caught her words.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, Madame," he said, "war is pitiful!
It is terrible and it is unnecessary!"
</p>

<p>
Madame looked at him wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"You speak our language well," she said.  The
tales of German efficiency, their ability to do all
things, had not been exaggerated.
</p>

<p>
"I was one of the professors of languages at
Heidelburg," he said wistfully.  "I thought to spend
my life in instruction, not destruction."
</p>

<p>
Jacques stirred at his voice.
</p>

<p>
"He was good to me, mother," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, <i>mon chéri</i>," soothed Nanine.  "I know!
Lie quietly!"
</p>

<p>
As she spoke the thunder of the guns seemed to
come nearer.  The women shuddered and the orderly
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"We seem to be getting in range," he said.  "I
advise you all to leave this place, and go further to
the rear."
</p>

<p>
Nanine's eyes were on her son.
</p>

<p>
"How can we move him?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Where can we go?" questioned Madame.
</p>

<p>
The orderly went to the door and peered out.
</p>

<p>
"He will be all right," he said.  "I'll hail one of
the passing ambulances.  It can take us all in."  He
left the room and hurried down the driveway to the
gate.
</p>

<p>
Angéle had Jacques' head against her breast now,
and old Nanine rose to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Madame," she pleaded, "let us go quickly.
I must save this one."
</p>

<p>
Her mistress looked about at the house and garden
where she had spent so many happy years, and
which, the loud roars of bursting shells warned her,
might be laid in ruins at any moment.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," she said resignedly, "the General will
know we have tried to reach safety.  He will understand."
</p>

<p>
The orderly at the gate had stopped a passing
ambulance.
</p>

<p>
"Hurry," he called.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Nanine to the German, "help carry
him.  Be careful!  Don't hurt him."
</p>

<p>
As they started through the door, the boy turned
and smiled into his mother's face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right, mother," he said, and they went out
to the waiting motor, little Angéle at their heels.
</p>

<p>
With a feeling of utter hopelessness Marie watched
them go, the empty coffee pot in one hand, the plate
of bread in the other.  All this could mean only one
thing.  The battle had been lost.  Paulette had been
too late, or had perished on the way.  Before her
wide, horror-stricken eyes was a vision of Gerome,
dead on the field, his forgiveness lost to her forever.
</p>

<p>
Madame put a gentle hand on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," she said hurriedly, "there is no time to
lose."  At her words the girl seemed to waken as
from a trance.
</p>

<p>
"No," she cried, "no&mdash;no&mdash;no!"
</p>

<p>
"You must come," pleaded her mother-in-law, but
the girl shook her head wildly.
</p>

<p>
"I am not going," she cried.  Life, for her, was
finished and over.  The elder woman tried to urge
her, half dragging her through the door as the
terrific roar of a shell bursting quite near the
château, thundered in their ears, but the girl
struggled and broke away.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the air seemed to split with a
deafening explosion, a splintering of glass, a flash of
flame.  The acrid, bitter smell of powder and smoke
was stifling.
</p>

<p>
Madame staggered against the door as the orderly,
his head held low, came running through the
courtyard.  He grasped her by the hand and dragged her
out to the waiting ambulance.
</p>

<p>
Marie, half fainting, fell on the couch, her head
buried deep in the cushions.
</p>

<p>
Her last conscious thoughts were:
</p>

<p>
"Let the house fall upon me, the ruins cover me
deep!  They cannot bury my grief!"

CHAPTER XXXVIII
</h3>

<p>
For awhile she lay motionless, half stunned by the
force of the explosion.  When full consciousness
returned to her the firing had grown fainter, more
infrequent.  She rose to her feet and went to the
window.  Out in the courtyard a great hole gaped where
the shell had struck.  Glass from the windows lay
scattered about, a garden bench was splintered and
overturned.  Havoc and ruin stared back at her.
Had Madame and the rest escaped?  Or had they
been killed, and she, alone, left untouched?
</p>

<p>
She stood in the center of the room, dazed, her
fingers clutching nervously, her chin quivering.  It
seemed years ago that she had arrived here with
Gerome to be in the shelter of his home, to be with
his people in her hour of need, and now she was alone.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to see France, like the bleeding body
of a woman, lying dead at her feet.  Her wild eyes
visioned Gerome's white, upturned face, staring
vacantly at the sky he loved.  She tore at her breast,
panting for breath.
</p>

<p>
"God!  God!" she cried.  "What have I left in all
the world?  Why am I not lying out there with
Gerome?  Gerome, I will not go on without you, I
can't!"
</p>

<p>
She stopped her hysterical crying.  Her hands
dropped to her sides, her mouth set.  She remembered
seeing a pistol in the drawer of the little desk when
the General had opened it searching for some
papers.
</p>

<p>
She walked slowly toward it now as though propelled
by some force outside of herself.  With shaking
fingers she pulled open the drawer and for a moment
stared down at the weapon.  After a hesitating effort
she forced herself to pick it up, but the touch of the
steel set her trembling.
</p>

<p>
"It's cold," she shuddered.  "It's horrible," and
then after a moment she closed her eyes and whispered
a prayer for strength.
</p>

<p>
Her pitiful weakness disgusted her.  With nothing
left to live for she was even afraid to die.  Slowly
she raised the pistol to her heart, her eyes tightly
shut, her lips pressed in a stiff blue line.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she stopped, her eyes sprang open.
Footsteps were coming up the path, running,
stumbling, heavy footsteps.  Marie wheeled, the hand
with the pistol hidden behind her back.
</p>

<p>
Someone came through the outer door and crossed
the hall.  She backed against the wall, her hand still
behind her.  The door was kicked open.  A man
stood on the threshold, dusty, bloody, spent with
running.  His face was twisted with hate, his lips
drawn back from his teeth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p293"></a>
"You!" she breathed, for her wide, frightened eyes
were staring straight into the terrible ones of Von
Pfaffen.
</p>

<p>
"You she-devil," his voice was curiously low; "you
thought to trick me, didn't you?  You thought by
giving me the wrong information you'd be rid of
me!  Do you know what you have done?  You have
killed hundreds, thousands of your countrymen.  You
have sent them to their death in vain!"
</p>

<p>
She was following his words, shaking, sinking
almost to her knees, cringing before the blow she
knew was coming.
</p>

<p>
The man's fury was blinding him.  He took a step
toward her.  She must be tortured for what she had
done to him.
</p>

<p>
"You let me take that information to my
superiors," he cried hoarsely; "they acted upon it.
You brought ruin to my cause, disgrace to me.  My
career is ended.  Did you imagine you could deceive
me and no harm come to you?"
</p>

<p>
In Marie's breast a faint suspicion of what had
taken place was awakening.  She scarcely dared
voice it, even to herself.
</p>

<p>
"I gave you information," she panted, but Von
Pfaffen burst in upon her words with a string of vile
oaths.
</p>

<p>
"But wrong!  Wrong!" he shouted.  "Twenty
miles wrong!"
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head, a breathless, wondering hope
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And the French have won?"
</p>

<p>
His face was black.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, damn them and you!" he swore.  She still
leaned against the wall, the blood throbbed in her
fingers clutching the pistol behind her back, but
through her heart surged a wave of joy, of
thankfulness.  Paulette had been in time!
</p>

<p>
"Everything has gone wrong," he snarled, "even
that message I sent the other night never reached its
destination."
</p>

<p>
"There was no message sent," she said in a clear,
distinct voice.
</p>

<p>
He stopped in the step he was taking toward her.
The look of sheer hatred that burned across his face
would have set her cowering with terror at another
time, but now, the knowledge that she had helped
France, and aided her husband's cause, lifted her
above the thought of fear.
</p>

<p>
"I took that tracing when your back was turned,"
she went on in the same clear voice.  "I burned it!"
</p>

<p>
The man made a sound in his throat as though he
were choking, his face turned purple, his brilliant
eyes burned with the fury of a maniac.
</p>

<p>
"You who did that!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him defiantly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did it!" she said, "and I knew the information
I gave you yesterday was wrong.  I sent you to
a place twenty miles away from where I knew the
attack was to be made.  I sent the word after you
that warned Sains, that brought victory to my
husband's cause!"  And then something of the look that
had been in Madame's eyes when she had echoed the
Marseillaise flashed into her own, and she finished in
a ringing voice, "for my own cause!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen was quite close to her now.  The veins
in his neck were swollen and throbbing, the whites of
his eyes shot with little lines of red.  There were
spatters of foam in the corners of his thin lips.
</p>

<p>
"So that's what you did!" he hissed.  "You devil!
I'll make you wish you had never been born!  I'll make
your husband, if he is still alive, despise you!  I'll
make his people turn you out of their house!  I'll
make your own people shoot you as a spy if ever you
cross their border."
</p>

<p>
She was watching him like a cat watches a vicious,
brutal dog that she knows is going to spring as soon
as he has finished worrying her.  Her teeth were
tearing at her under lip, the fingers of her free hand
picked at her gown.  Why didn't he kill her and end
it all, she wondered?  His nearness sent a wave of
sickening nausea surging over her.  The blood was
pounding in her ears.  His words came to her
through it all.
</p>

<p>
"I'll force you into the streets where you belong,"
he shouted in her face.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes narrowed.
</p>

<p>
"If my husband were here," she said slowly, "he
would kill you for that!"
</p>

<p>
Von Pfaffen flung a vile oath at her.
</p>

<p>
"When your husband sees you again," he said, "if
he ever does, it will be to find you dead, and glad of
it!"
</p>

<p>
Marie laughed a clear, ringing laugh, cold and
absolutely mirthless.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I fear death?" she said.  "If my
husband comes back I am going to tell him everything,
and when he knows the truth he will kill you
like a rat."
</p>

<p>
The man stopped and looked at her a moment,
insolently, arrogantly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, he won't," he said, quite calmly; "I've
planned differently."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you are going to leave this room
alive?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of death!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her venomously.
</p>

<p>
"You're not afraid," he sneered.  "Do you know
what I am going to do?"  His eyes were so evil that
she cringed back against the protecting wall.  "After
I have killed you, I am going to tell your story in
my own way," his meaning was only too plain.
</p>

<p>
"You devil," she whispered.  A wave of red surged
up staining her white throat and pale face.
</p>

<p>
A horrible smile broadened his wicked mouth.  He
had touched her.
</p>

<p>
"There will be more than one man concerned in
the story I shall tell."
</p>

<p>
"You know that's a lie!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"How do I know?  There may have been a dozen
before I found you."
</p>

<p>
So that was what he would tell Gerome, that would
be his revenge!
</p>

<p>
"You coward!" she panted; "you monster!  I'm
glad you failed!  Thank God your cause has
failed; I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Beside himself with rage, he sprang toward her,
clutching his hands about her throat.
</p>

<p>
"You're glad, are you?" he hissed; "you're glad!"
</p>

<p>
She struggled in his grasp.  Suddenly there was a
flash, a sharp report, then breathless silence.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the man stared horribly into her
eyes, his hands at her throat clutched spasmodically
once, twice, almost shutting away her breath before
they loosened.  He coughed, a queer, sputtering
cough, straightened his thin shoulders jerkily, and
then grotesquely spun about and fell sprawling to
the floor, where he lay quiet.
</p>

<p>
Marie looked down at the smoking pistol that hung
in her limp hand.  She stared at it fascinated as
though seeing it for the first time.
</p>

<p>
He had fallen quite close to the threshold of the
door and keeping her eyes carefully averted from
his sprawled body she walked slowly over to the
little desk.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely realizing what she was doing, she placed
the pistol in the drawer and covered it up with
papers; then she shut the drawer and securely locked
it.  Her mind was curiously numb, as she turned and
looked down at the dead man.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she swayed irresolutely, then with
a supreme effort went over to where he lay.
Shuddering, her whole soul revolting at her task, she
stooped and dragged the body across the threshold
and out into the hall.
</p>

<p>
He was a horrible sight.  The sneer of hate had
frozen on his face.  His eyes stared wide, and his coat
hunched about his shoulders where she had clutched
it in dragging him through the door.
</p>

<p>
With a stifled scream she ran back into the salon,
closing and locking the door; then she turned, leaning
against the barrier between herself and what had
been her evil genius.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," she cried, "I'm free!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX
</h3>

<p>
When there has been a shade or promise of evil
hanging over our lives, when we have waked each
morning with the dread of what the day may bring,
and go to bed at night to toss and turn in fear
of the morrow, and then, suddenly, we find that the
thing we feared has happened, instead of the appalling
terror and the horror of its consequences that
we anticipated, very often there is a sense of infinite
relief, that now no worse can come, for the worst has
happened.
</p>

<p>
So it was with Marie.  With the closing and locking
of the door on the dead body of Von Pfaffen, a
great, numb calmness enveloped her.  He was dead.
She had killed him.  Nothing mattered.  There was
nothing to matter.  The world, for her, was finished.
She wondered in a curious subconscious way why
she did not care.  She had taken a human life, yet
she felt no remorse, no fear.  All emotion was dead
in her heart.  She only knew that she was tired,
terribly tired.  Her knees seemed to give way under
her.  She stumbled, dragged herself with the help of
her icy hands, hanging onto the chairs, groping along
the edge of the table.  She only knew she must reach
the couch, which seemed so far away, where she
could rest.  Her mouth was dry, her tongue felt
swollen.  It was an effort to close or raise the heavy
lids over her burning eyes.  A dreadful sense of dizzy
nausea struck her.  Suffocating waves of blackness
seemed to beat up from her heart and surge across
her vision.
</p>

<p>
With a supreme effort she made a last tottering
step toward the haven she was trying to reach, and
pitched headlong across the couch, a great darkness
wrapping her close.
</p>

<p>
The day wore on, the cannonading had rumbled
off into silence, the frightened birds had come back,
and here and there, through the garden, they
twittered nervously to one another.
</p>

<p>
The sky was overcast now, the air had grown heavy
with the promise of a storm.  Every now and then
a little gust of wind, pungent with the smell of
powder, blew in along the terrace and through the
shattered windows.  It shook the curtains, fluttered
across the unconscious head of the woman, lifted a
lock of disheveled hair, eddied among the papers on
the little desk, stirred about the disordered room and
died away.
</p>

<p>
Marie was mercifully shut away from the world,
her strained nerves had snapped.  She could bear no
more.
</p>

<p>
Outside in the hall, behind the locked door, the
dead man lay, staring horribly, a tiny stream of
blood staining the marble floor.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * *
</p>

<p>
When Gerome jumped from his dusty, battered
motor, late in the afternoon, it was with a heart full
of foreboding that he found the great gates open.
The terrible havoc wrought by the bursting shell
frightened him.  He dared not ask himself what he
might find.
</p>

<p>
He hurried up the gravel walk, his head splitting
and pounding from a gash across his brows, which
had been bound up hastily.  His face was grimy, and
there were discolored circles about his eyes.  He ran
along the terrace and past the entrance door, knowing
he would find whoever was left in the house here,
in the little salon.
</p>

<p>
At the window he paused, his quick eye took in the
disorder, the signs of the struggle, the body of the
girl lying inert across the couch, her dress crumpled
and torn, her yellow hair, loose from its pins, hanging
in a long loop over her shoulder.  With a cry he ran
across to her and lifted her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he cried, but her head fell back heavily
against his breast.
</p>

<p>
Gently he laid her down on the cushions, a dreadful
fear in his heart that this might mean death.
The bowl of water and the bandages that had been
brought for Jacques were on the table.  Hastily he
wet a cloth, and kneeling by the girl's side brushed
back the hair from her brow and moistened her closed
eyes and lips.
</p>

<p>
Presently she stirred, her lids fluttered.
</p>

<p>
"Marie darling!" he said.  "Tell me, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
The girl opened her eyes and looked into his.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she whispered, "is it really you?"  Her
eyes were devouring him hungrily, lovingly, the man
she had never hoped to see again.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she became conscious of the bandage
around his head.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome!" she cried, "you are hurt!"
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing," he hastened to assure her, "only a
scratch.  I have glorious news!  We have won!  It's
victory for France!"
</p>

<p>
"Victory!" she repeated dully, then after a
moment, "God is good to us!"
</p>

<p>
He drew her to him tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"I had word that mother and the servants were
safe," he said, "but when I learned that you were not
with them, I was mad with fear that you might be
injured.  I got leave to come and find you, and thank
God, I have!"
</p>

<p>
He had come back to her, but it was too late, her
hands were stained with blood.  An overwhelming
sense of what she had lost swept over her.  She
turned her face against his sleeve, weeping hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, dearest," he whispered, "luck was with us,
don't you hear?  We struck just where the enemy's
lines were weakest.  Our aviators reported them
massing their troops at Sains, but the attack there
was a complete failure.  The town must have been
warned!"
</p>

<p>
Sains had been warned!
</p>

<p>
That was something to weigh against the heavy
burden of sorrow she had to bear!
</p>

<p>
Holding her close he listened, while she told him
of their experience in the château during the battle,
and then for a long while they sat silent, their arms
about one another, cheek against cheek.  Death had
been so close to both, might take one of them
to-morrow, but he had her now in his arms, warm,
palpitating, trembling with the love he knew was for
him.
</p>

<p>
The light began to fade, the silence broken only
by the distant muttering of the guns.
</p>

<p>
"Little Sainte Marie," he whispered, "to me you
are symbolic of everything that is good and pure!"
</p>

<p>
Across Marie's mental vision flashed the picture
of Von Pfaffen's body lying out beyond the locked
door.  He was dead.  There was no need that anyone
should ever know of her past with him.  Everyone
else who knew was dead.  Her word would be sufficient.
She had only to say that she had discovered
him to be a spy; that he had come back and, finding
her alone, attacked her, and in defense of her honor,
she had killed him.
</p>

<p>
She had sinned, yet she had suffered.  Had she
not paid the price in full?  Must she drain the cup
of bitterness to the last dregs?  Surely heaven did
not expect this sacrifice.  Would it not make Gerome
more unhappy to know the truth?  Would it not,
indeed, be wrong of her to confess?  It was written,
"Let the dead past bury its dead!"  Why draw this
grisly skeleton into the light of day?  She had
suffered enough.  She wanted happiness, and to tell
Gerome meant to crucify that happiness.  Surely,
other women in the past had erred and then married
and lived contentedly, without discovery or confession.
She had been so young, so innocent, so unprepared.
It was her inexperience that was to blame,
not she herself.  In heart she had always been pure,
her desire had always been to be good.  Her
conscience acquitted her.  Her decision was made.  She
would not tell.
</p>

<p>
Gerome's eyes held hers.  At all costs she must
keep the love she saw shining there.  She answered
his look with one of passionate adoration.
</p>

<p>
"Marie," he said softly, "thank God that you are
safe.  I dare not even imagine what it would have
meant to me if I had come back and found anything
had happened to you."
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"How wonderful it is," he said at last, "to have an
ideal realized.  You are everything I ever dreamed a
woman should be.  If I should die to-morrow, it would
be with the knowledge that the woman I loved had
been worthy of my implicit faith."
</p>

<p>
Faith!  The word sank into her heart.  It stirred
and brought to life again, conscience.  What was it
to have implicit faith?  How did one deserve that?
</p>

<p>
He looked gravely into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"All human happiness is founded on faith!" he said.
</p>

<p>
He believed in her.  Oh, God, the pity of it!  He
believed in her, and how had she repaid his trust?
</p>

<p>
She had hidden her past from him, and lived a lie
all these days of her marriage, in order to shield
herself and keep his faith in her.
</p>

<p>
To tell him meant to lose his love.  But could she
go on like this, living a lie?  How glorious, how
beautiful it would be, what inexpressible joy, if she
only were the woman he thought her.  If she only
had come to him with clean hands.  If the exchange
had only been equal.  But the fact that this was not
so, could not be eradicated.  She was what she was,
what circumstances had made her.  She knew that
she was cheating him.  Again, she brought her soul
before the judgment bar of her conscience, and this
time the verdict was "Guilty!"
</p>

<p>
Cost what it may, she must tell him.
</p>

<p>
The pitiful weakness of her character that had
made her drift, postponing the inevitable day of
reckoning, had passed.  She must flay her very soul,
and stand before him as she was.
</p>

<p>
She became conscious of his voice telling the story
of the battle, of his love for her, of their future
happiness.
</p>

<p>
Their future happiness!
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she said slowly, her voice vibrant with
suppressed emotion, "there is something I must tell
you, something I have been too cowardly to let you
know before.  I'm tired of lying!  Tired of hiding!
Ashamed of accepting your love, when I know it is
undeserved.  I am not what you think me!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, startled.
</p>

<p>
"Marie&mdash;&mdash;" he began.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;don't stop me," she said quietly, but firmly,
"let me tell you everything.  When you married me
you thought me a pure young girl, coming to you
from the convent, untouched by the world.  I
wasn't&mdash;I&mdash;there was another man in Vienna."
</p>

<p>
He clutched her arm in a grip that made her wince
with pain.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  His voice was hoarse and
strange.
</p>

<p>
She drew away from him.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would shrink from me!  I knew you
would loathe me when you learned the truth.  I'm not
trying to exonerate myself, not trying to make
excuses.  I was young, scarcely more than a child.  I
told you I had never known my mother.  When my
father died, I was left penniless, without friends,
without the knowledge of how to support myself.  I
was unused to the fight, unequal to it.  One day I met
a man who singled me out, a smile on his lips, black
lies in his heart.  He promised me what I longed for,
protection, a home, marriage&mdash;and I believed him!"
</p>

<p>
Her words swept over Gerome in a devastating
wave, leaving his face livid.  The bandage across his
forehead reddened with the fresh bleeding of his
wound.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," he whispered hoarsely, "tell me everything!"
</p>

<p>
"He found me singing in a little Bohemian café;
it was the only thing I could do to earn my living.
He befriended me, was kind to me, and before I knew
where I was drifting, it had all happened.  Too late,
I realized what I meant in the scheme of his world, a
plaything, a new toy for a day to be tossed aside
when my novelty had worn off.  When I knew the
truth, I left it all.  I came to Paris, where I had
distant relatives.  I threw myself on their mercy.  They
were good people, as you know.  They took me in.
I tried to forget!  I never wanted to see anything
of the old life again.  As the months passed I
believed myself safe, and then you came," her voice
lifted, rang clear; "you, the man I had dreamed of,
whom I thought could not exist outside of dreams.
All the love, all the passion, all the adoration a woman
is capable of, I gave to you.  The rest of my life you
know, every minute, every thought of it, up to&mdash;up
to the day you brought me here.  I was so hungry
for happiness.  You were my world.  I couldn't bear
to think of losing you.  I decided not to tell you.  I
would make amends in a hundred ways for the deception.
I tried to!  I thought the past was dead, dead
and buried.  God, how I deluded myself!  When we
arrived here, here in your father's home, all the
sunshine, all the joy went out of my life, for I came
face to face with that man!"
</p>

<p>
"Here?  You're mad!"  The gentleness, the refinement
had vanished from his expression, leaving
the face of primitive man thirsting to get his fingers
on the throat of his enemy.  "Who is he?  Tell me
his name!"
</p>

<p>
She kept her eyes on his.
</p>

<p>
"He was known in this house as Antoine," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Antoine!" his lips curled with unutterable
loathing, "Antoine!  A servant!"
</p>

<p>
"He was not a servant.  He was a spy in the
service of the enemy!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome dropped her arm as though the touch
seared his fingers, horror and amazement in his face.
</p>

<p>
"A spy!  Good God!  Then what are you?"
</p>

<p>
She nerved herself.  The look in his eyes spelled
death for her, but she must go on.
</p>

<p>
"When I saw him, I was wild with terror.  He
offered me a price for his silence.  I was to get some
information he wanted.  What was I to do?  What
could I do?  I only knew that I loved you, that I
wanted to keep you.  I only knew that I was going
mad with the fear of losing you!  I promised to do
what he asked!"
</p>

<p>
"What was it?"  His voice was low, even, deadly.
She knew there could be no hope for her, but the
oblivion of death would be welcome.
</p>

<p>
"I made you tell me where the attack was to be
made.  This was the information he wanted."
</p>

<p>
He recoiled, his eyes fixed on her with a look of
unutterable horror.
</p>

<p>
"You sold my honor, my country!" he said at last.
"You, whom I trusted with more than my life.  Well,
there's only one thing to do.  Both of us must
die!"  Slowly he drew his pistol, his face cold and white as
marble.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she whispered.  "I'm ready, I'm willing
to die, but before, I want you to know everything."  He
lowered his arm and looked at her.  "I knew that
if I defied him he would get his information some
other way.  I knew I must seem to play into his
hands, and thwart his purpose.  I gave him information,
but wrong, twenty miles wrong!  It was I who
sent the warning to Sains!  And I know it reached
there in time!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he told me!"
</p>

<p>
"Told you?  Where?  When?  Where is he now?"  His
face worked, his lips were drawn back from his
teeth, his voice hoarse with passion.
</p>

<p>
For a moment she stood rigid, then she stepped to
the hall door and threw it open.
</p>

<p>
"He is here!" she said.
</p>

<p>
Together they looked at the dead man at their
feet.  Gerome raised his eyes to hers.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;&mdash;?" he said.
</p>

<p>
She nodded slowly.
</p>

<p>
"He came here, just before you did, to be revenged
upon me.  He said I had deliberately given
him the wrong information.  He taunted me with
the past.  He, who had caused it all!  He threatened
my life, said he would force me out of your arms and
into the streets, where I belonged.  So I killed him!"
</p>

<p>
Gerome threw his arm up across his eyes.  His
shoulders shook with dry sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"Marie, Marie," he cried.  "Oh God! my world lies
shattered at my feet!"
</p>

<p>
"And mine&mdash;and mine," she whispered.

<h3>
CHAPTER XL
</h3>

<p>
Night had fallen, dull, black, the sky overhung
with great masses of heavy clouds.  Like a ghost of
herself Marie sat staring out of the window into the
depths of the deserted garden.  Still, calm with the
calmness that comes after storm, her unseeing eyes
gazed straight ahead of her.  How long she had sat
there she knew not.  She was filled with that curious,
numb quiet that comes to one when all fear, all hate,
all terror has departed.  She was resigned to
anything fate might decree for her.
</p>

<p>
When she had told Gerome all the bitter truth,
he had left her without a word.  Later she had heard
vague shuffling sounds in the hall, the closing of the
outer door, his steps crunching on the gravel.  Her
staring eyes had tried vainly to pierce the velvet
blackness outside the window.  Instinctively she
knew what errand had taken him out into the garden.
She could almost hear the thud of earth falling on
the dead face of Von Pfaffen.
</p>

<p>
The guns still muttered and boomed, lighting the
black horizon with sullen, intermittent flashes.  As
she sat waiting her whole brief life unfolded before
her.  The years at the convent, her unhappiness, her
struggles with poverty, the tragedy, as she saw it
now, of her lost honor, her escape from it all, the
new, peaceful life, and then the coming of wonderful
happiness, the happiness of requited love, the
culmination of which was the knowledge that she was to be
the mother of Gerome's child.  She knew that,
although she had drained the cup of bitterness and
misery to its very dregs, still the pendulum had
swung as far the other way.  She had had those few
short months of supreme joy.  The price had been
a heavy one.  But in the light of retrospection she
knew that it was worth it.
</p>

<p>
Far into the night she sat thinking, dreaming,
staring out into the blackness.  Then she heard
Gerome's step again on the path, heard him
stumble in the darkness of the hall.  After a moment
he came in and sank heavily into a chair.  The clouds
had lifted, and an ominous red moon had risen, and
by its faint light she could see him sitting, his chin
in his hands.  He was thinking, brooding, comparing.
Almost as though he spoke them aloud, she could
follow his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
After the first bitter shock that had sent his idol
crashing to earth he had been shaken, frenzied, filled
with a curse for God and man.  But Marie's voice,
as she told him more of her story, had calmed him
in spite of himself, and some of the terrible rage and
horror he had felt had been laid with the body of his
enemy in the grave he had dug in the garden.  Alone,
by the side of that little mound he had battled with
himself, fought as great a fight with his soul as that
being waged by his country.  It became plain to him
that in a small way his problem with this woman who
was his wife reflected the mighty struggle going on
outside, which was to decide the destiny of nations.
It was as though he stood apart and looked down
from some height on a warring world.  Clearly the
great issues that were at stake rose before him, this
terrible war, which was to bring about perpetual
peace, establishing now and forever the brotherhood
of men, which was to build anew mankind and the arts
of civilization, was a baptism of blood out of which
would arise a new creation.  Through the vision he
became aware of the smallness of all things else.
</p>

<p>
Marie, sitting silently in the chair by the window,
timidly broke into his revery, hesitatingly, as one who
fears to waken a dreamer.
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she whispered, "Gerome!"
</p>

<p>
Across the silent garden, up from the distant
horizon, came a louder roll of guns, a fitful crash of
bursting shells, and then silence.  He sat motionless,
inert, as though he heard only his own thoughts, as
though he were deaf to outward sounds.
</p>

<p>
After a moment she began again:
</p>

<p>
"I had no one to tell me&mdash;no one to advise me.  I
was alone, more alone than you can ever understand.
At first just being happy was a thing so wonderful,
I clung to it, desired it above all else in the world.
But there was something more than that."  Slowly
he turned his head toward her.  She went on, her
voice firmer, steadier, "I realized that another life
was to come into the world, for whose happiness I
would be responsible!  The glory of it&mdash;your child!"
</p>

<p>
Across the mind of the man sitting motionless in
his chair flashed something of what she had suffered.
This child, the symbol of the love that had seemed
so perfect!  Perhaps it would be a daughter who
must be spared the sorrows, the privations, the lack
of protection, that had been her mother's undoing.
He began to see more clearly that in his first wild
grief and disappointment in her he had failed to
fully understand.  She had not succumbed to
temptation.  What she had done had never attracted her.
She had been like one who wanders alone in a wilderness,
and who falls a prey to wild beasts, or is overcome
by fatigue or hunger.  That she had sinned
was not her fault, rather it was her misfortune.  He
became conscious again of her voice, low, vibrant.
</p>

<p>
"In the beginning I withheld the truth from you
because I feared to lose your love.  Then when I
realized that a new life was to come into the world,
I could not bear that our child should know of its
mother's guilt.  I tried to save it the bitterness that
knowledge would bring.  Gerome, it was for that!"
</p>

<p>
His thoughts raced on.  She had been tempted,
then, not to shield herself, but because of her great
love for him, and to save one who was wholly innocent,
perhaps a lifetime of unhappiness.  He listened
while she told him little by little of her starved life,
her empty childhood in the colorless walls of the
convent, the far-between visits of her father, of those
short months of happiness in the little house in the
<i>Blumen Strasse</i>.  Her voice shook a little when she
told of her father's illness and his death, and her
terror at facing the world penniless and alone.  She
went over all her short life, her home with the kind
old Schultzes, her struggles to find employment,
finally, her singing in the café, her meeting with her
evil genius.
</p>

<p>
Sitting there, touched by the soft moonlight,
motionless, calm, without a shadow of the tears that
had so long been her refuge, she told her story with
the simple directness of a child.
</p>

<p>
Seeing her, hearing her story in its completeness,
realizing some of the pity that Christ must have felt
for the penitent Magdalene, more of the bitterness
died in Gerome's heart.  Had he not, in his blind fury,
judged too hastily this woman, whose weakness and
ignorance had made her the victim of unscrupulous
force and who had kept her sin secret through the
generous motive of saving him and his unborn child,
sorrow, shame?  Perhaps, after all, if regarded in its
true light, her soul was as pure as he had believed.
</p>

<p>
Secure in his own strength, firm in his own knowledge
of right and wrong, had he not condemned her
too quickly?
</p>

<p>
The muttering of the guns on the distant horizon
again reminded him of the struggle his country was
undergoing.  If strength could reproach weakness
for being overwhelmed by a force greater than itself,
then Belgium, ravished, devastated, bleeding Belgium,
deserved the reproach of the world, rather than
its pity.
</p>

<p>
The night was lifting; he looked at her silhouetted
against the gray square of the window.  Her white
dress was crumpled and torn, her yellow hair hung
loose over her shoulders.  She seemed to him a
symbol of Belgium, ravished, buffeted, beaten.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of human unhappiness is the
result of misunderstanding.  This terrible war, some
of the horrors of which were printed indelibly on his
soul, had come because of the misunderstanding that
existed between man and his brother.  Titanic force
in combat with Titanic force simply destroyed itself.
If the world was to endure, the great problems of
man must be answered by some other means.  There
would be a New Heaven and a New Earth to take the
place of those that had passed away.  Out of the
ashes of this war must rise a new era.  Old traditions
were falling away.  Superstition with regard to the
Divine Right of Kings, that Old Man of the Sea,
which mankind had carried on his back for so long,
retarding his efforts, using his strength and
substance, would be cast aside forever, and with the
freedom of unimpeded, reborn youth, man would rise
to that plane of development which was to fulfill his
destiny.
</p>

<p>
Surely then, since the life and history of each
individual was a world in itself, he and this woman
who was his wife could begin again, awaken into a
resurrection that would break the shackles of prejudice
and tradition and with that mutual understanding
which comes after such a storm as that through
which they had passed, work out their destinies with
a more certain knowledge of the things in life which
really make for happiness.
</p>

<p>
He rose to his feet and came and stood before her.
Silently she waited, motionless, still.  Her sentence
was about to be pronounced.  She was ready.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," he said at last; "out there the old world
is destroying itself in a flood of fire and hate.  Old
ideals are passing away.  Ambition, greed, love, even
hope itself is tottering into nothingness."
</p>

<p>
Hopelessly she echoed his words.
</p>

<p>
"Nothingness!"
</p>

<p>
"Marie, I have been thinking all night, and because
of the sorrow and suffering through which I
have gone, things seem clearer than ever before.  My
rage has been terrible.  My unhappiness almost
unbearable.  When you told me what you had done, I
thought life was not worth living another day.  I
had determined that both of us must die.  But all
that has passed away.  After this great struggle
which is going on between the nations of the earth is
over, something new and better must come.  Shall
we be part of it, begin life afresh, and see if, after
all, there is not some happiness left for us?"
</p>

<p>
Her face was transfigured with a great light.
</p>

<p>
"You can say that to me?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He took both her hands in his, his voice gentle,
through his suffering and hers.
</p>

<p>
"Shall there be a resurrection that shall be built
on perfect understanding?"
</p>

<p>
"Gerome," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
The vigil he had kept with his soul through this
long and terrible night, the task he had made for
himself when he buried Von Pfaffen's body in the
garden, the knowledge of her ordeal, of her lifting
of herself above the weakness that had threatened
to engulf her, the strength that had made her confess
when there had been no need of confession, had
shown him what the new life for both of them might
mean.
</p>

<p>
"A resurrection," he went on, "where it shall be
clear that the world can live only so long as love
shall live."
</p>

<p>
She lifted her eyes to his.
</p>

<p>
"'Love shall wipe away all tears,'" she whispered,
almost as though she were uttering a prayer.
</p>

<p>
Gerome held her hands against his breast.
</p>

<p>
"You and I, dear," he said earnestly, "shall we
start anew, and when we reach the far horizon look
back on this hour as a story that is told?  For to
understand all is to forgive all!"
</p>

<p>
The traces of her bitter suffering were still on her
face, but she looked at him happily.
</p>

<p>
"An hour ago," she said softly, "I thought I had
nothing left to live for, but the doors of life are just
opening.  Look&mdash;&mdash;"  Together they turned toward
the window.
</p>

<p>
Toward the West, the clouds hung black and
ominous, the last draperies of departing night, from
whence came the persistent thunder of the guns,
where men strove, destroying the old world in a hell
of blood and steel.  But on the Eastern horizon,
turning all the hills to ruddy gold, was the rising
sun.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in a hidden thicket a bird twittered on
its nest.
</p>

<p>
She looked up into his face, the light of her great
love shining in her eyes, and whispered almost as
though it were a prophecy:
</p>

<p>
"I can see the light of a new day!"
</p>
